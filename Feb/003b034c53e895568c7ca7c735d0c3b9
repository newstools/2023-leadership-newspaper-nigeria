Over 3,000 members of the All Progressives Congress (APC)  in Edo State have defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The former APC members joined the PDP at several campaign rallies of the PDP held at the weekend in various communities in Ovia Southwest and Ovia Northeast local government areas. They tore their APC membership cards and vowed to ensure the PDP emerged victorious in next month’s general election. Many of the defectors said they are tired of the suffering, poverty brought by the APC led federal government. Among those that defected were chairman of all the chairmen in APC Ovia South West, Sunday Kriya,  PDP Chairman Ora, Ward 6 Ovia South west, Hon. Osawaru Sunday, Comrade West Odaro,  and his assistant Hon. Fedric Igbinowanhia, a former APC Ward Chairman in the riverine area, Comrade Sunny Emuobor, Francis  Kumukumu Achugbue from Okada ward amongst others. Kumukumu, who predicted that the APC would fail at the elections said they regretted voting for Idahosa in 2019. Another former APC leader, Sunday Kriya, said they would deliver 100 per cent vote for the APC and its House of Representatives, Barr. Omosede Igbinedion. He said Omosede provided empowerment for their youths as well gave financial support to their wives when she was first elected to the House of Representatives. On her part, Omosede promised to work with the state government when elected to ensure communities benefit more. She said her focus would be the farmers to boost food security as well as ensure empowerment for women. Omosede appealed to all PDP members to consider last week’s Supreme Court judgement which affirmed her candidacy as the end of all factions within the party.
