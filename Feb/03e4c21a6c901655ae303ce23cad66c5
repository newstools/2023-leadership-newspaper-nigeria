Immediate-past governor of Ogun State and Senator representing Ogun Central senatorial district on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ibikunle Amosun, on Wednesday, led the chieftains of rival African Democratic Congress (ADC) to flag-off the party’s governorship campaign for the 2023 elections in the State. The APC Senator, who has been openly campaigning for ADC governorship candidate, Barr. Biyi Otegbeye, said he wanted someone that will continue the laudable legacies he left behind in the State as governor about four years ago. Lamenting that the current APC-led administration of Governor Dapo Abiodun has derailed from the tragectory of development, which he started in 2011, Amosun said his campaign for ADC was not about him, but the future of Ogun State.
