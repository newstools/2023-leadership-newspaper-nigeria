Sergio Ramos was seen shoving a photographer after Paris Saint-Germain’s 1-0 defeat in their Champions League round of 16 first leg against Bayern Munich on Tuesday. Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbappe returned to PSG’s squad from injury but were unable to turn their side’s poor form. Christophe Galtier’s side have now lost their last three matches and the defeat to Bayern has put their Champions League campaign in jeopardy. Video footage showed defender Ramos pushing the photographer who was close to him while some PSG players were saluting the crowd at the Parc des Princes after the final whistle. Bayern dominated much of the game and had chances to double their lead after Coman’s 53rd-minute winner. Up to that point, the likes of Leo Messi and Neymar were struggling to find their way into the match, and it was the introduction of Kylian Mbappe in the second half that shifted the balance of the game back into the hosts’ favour. Mbappe had two goals disallowed because of offside, while Messi had a shot turned over by a brilliant block from Bayern defender Benjamin Pavard. But Pavard’s late red card for a second bookable offence was the only blight on an otherwise near-perfect evening for Julian Nagelsmann’s Bayern Munich. PSG and manager Christophe Galtier have it all to do if they are to overturn this deficit in Munich on March 8 for the return leg. The winning punch came from one of PSG’s former sons, Coman — the same man who scored the winner when the two teams met in the Champions League final back in 2020. It was a neatly worked goal as half-time substitute Alphonso Davies’ cross found an unmarked Coman, who side-footed it home underneath goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. Coman didn’t celebrate, the crowd went silent and Bayern trotted back to the halfway line to plan another series of carefully crafted attacks. PSG and UEFA were not immediately available for comment. The return leg takes place at the Allianz Arena in Munich on March 8. .
