 The African Democratic Congress (ADC) and its governorship candidate in Rivers State, has dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, before a Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking for the postponement of the March 11, 2023 Governorship and House of Assembly elections in the State. Joined in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/246/2023, were the Attorney-General of Rivers State and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Ex-parte Motion, which was obtained by LEADERSHIP in Port Harcourt, revealed that the ADC and its governorship candidate were seeking for order of interim injunction restraining INEC from going ahead with the said elections in the State. The plaintiffs were also seeking for an order of interim injunction restraining State governor from implementing and enforcing Executive Orders 21 and 22, which were signed by Governor Wike in October and November, 2022, respectively. The plaintiffs insisted that the implementation and enforcement of the Executive Orders 21 and 22, have created a state of disorder and political crisis in the State, making it impossible for political parties, except the ruling PDP and its candidates, from engaging freely in political activities in the State. The court document reads in part: “An Order of interim injunction restraining the first defendant by itself, it’s representatives, agents, privies, and/or anybody acting through it from implementation and enforcement of the Executive Order 21 2022 issued on 4th October, 2022 and Executive Order 22 2022, issued on 11th November, 2022, by the first defendant pending the determination of the motion on notice before this Honourable Court. “An Order of interim injunction restraining the 4th defendant by itself, it’s representatives, agents, privies, and/or anybody acting through it from proceeding to conduct the forthcoming gubernatorial election scheduled to hold on March 11, 2023, in Rivers State, pending the determination of the motion on notice before this Honourable Court.”
