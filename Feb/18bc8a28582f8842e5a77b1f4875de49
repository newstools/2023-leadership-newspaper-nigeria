Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has urged Nigerians not to allow the forthcoming election be determined by bullion van tendencies. Atiku, in a message to his supporters via email, was apparently referring to the two bullion vans seen entering the premises of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, ahead of the 2019 general election. He urged Nigerians to use the power of their Permanent Voters Card (PVC) to channel their frustration to vote out the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the forthcoming general election. Atiku said, “A few days ago, I had cause to make a statement on the currency conversion policy of the federal government. “In the said statement, I aligned my position with an upsurge of demands for a slight extension of the January 31st deadline.
