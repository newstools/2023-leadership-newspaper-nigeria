A youth-based group in the Kogi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), known as New Generation, has described the presidential candidate of the party, Atiku Abubarkar, and his running mate, Ifeanyi Okowa, as most qualified to lead the country from May 29, 2023.  The group made this known during the end of a mop-up campaign exercise across the three Senatorial Districts spanning 21 Local Government Areas of Kogi State.  According to the state coordinator of the group, Adamu Ibrahim, while addressing journalists at the event, he expressed his delight at the warm reception accorded to him and his team across the state, which he described as a testament to Atiku/Okowa candidacy’s acceptance amongst the people of the state.  “I and my team have successfully toured the 3 Senatorial Districts spanning 21 Local governments for the mop-up campaign exercise in Kogi State to sensitise voters, particularly at the grassroots level on the important need to Vote-In Atiku/Okowa in the coming election.  “The response we got from the voters across the state during this exercise reiterates our confidence that the Atiku/Okowa presidency will have a landslide victory and Kogi State has assured us of voting in the PDP considering the fact the presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar and the Vice-presidential candidate, Ifeanyi Okowa, are the most experienced among the contestants,” he enthused.  During the exercise, the mop-up campaign team in various local government areas like Kogi, Lokoja, Bassa, Okene, Amkpa, Idah, Kabba, Ajaokuta, Igala Mela and others in the state had one-on-one interactions with the voters on the streets, markets, motor parks and strategic locations.  Ibrahim thanked the good people of Kogi State for their cooperation during this exercise and assured them that Kogi State would not be left out in enjoying the dividends of democracy under the Atiku/Okowa presidency.
