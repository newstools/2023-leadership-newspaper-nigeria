A coalition of northern youth living in Lagos State has called on the people of Northern Nigeria to avoid repeating the mistake they made in the past by trading their future in the 2023 general elections. The chairman of association, Alhaji Ibrahim Yaro Galadanci, said the association had learnt with dismay that some politicians in the region were rooting for corrupt and incredible presidential candidates ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Citing prevalent poverty, insecurity, and economic backwardness in the region, the association warned  people of the region to not allow selfish politicians from the region to gamble with their future and that of their children. The association argued that there had been plans to destabilize the region since the return to democratic rule in 1999, urging the people not to succumb to the pressure. Alhaji Galadanci said, “This is the right time we will unite and face our challenges. Northern  Muslims and Christians should keep their differences aside and face a common enemy. There has been a plan to destabilize the region since 1999. Selfish politicians use religious differences in the region to advance their interest. “For this, we are calling Nigerians of northern extraction to not allow selfish politicians fool them in 2023. The North must unite to change its fortune. The North is rich in both human and natural resources, but why are we becoming slaves to some politicians’ desires? We have to wake up “It is understandable that Boko Haram and farmer-herder crisis were hatched as part of that sinister plan to destroy the North. And since this could not work, now they arm some bandits and kidnappers to make life difficult for northerners. “Our people must to be enlightened to understand the situation the region has found itself today. Moves must be made to align the presidential candidates of the NNPP, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and Major Hamza Al-Mustapha to face those selfish and recycled politicians.”
