Members of the Chartered Institute of Export and Commodity Brokers of Nigeria (CIECOBON) have solicited the support of Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) in promoting non-oil export in the country. During a visit to the NSC last week, CIECOBON president, Ayobami Omotoso, called on the federal government to establish port facilities dedicated to exports. LEADERSHIP reports that CIECOBO came into existence in 2015 following National Assembly’s approval of the merger of the Institute of Export of Nigeria (IEON) and Commodity Brokers Association of Nigeria (CBAN). The CIECOBON president said, lack of flat-bottomed vessels to transport cargos to Apapa rendered the use of Ikorodu Lighter Terminal once designated for export, a dead on arrival decision. Dr. Omotoso disclosed that, one of the shipping lines operating in the sub-region has been providing open roof-top vessels for Ghanaian exporters of produce. He pleaded with NSC to discuss the possibility of extending such a service to Nigerian exporters because the RIFA containers that should ordinarily be used are too expensive for many exporters. In his response, the executive secretary, Nigerian Shippers’ Council, Emmanuel Jime, warmly welcomed the delegation and assured them that part of NSC’s mandate, being in alliance with that of CIECOBON, will result in a partnership that will benefit the nation’s economy. He commended the doggedness of CIECOBON in promoting export through advocacy and capacity building. He enjoined the body to keep forging ahead in its mission with patriotic zeal. He also assured Dr. Omotoso and his delegation that NSC will discuss the request for open rooftop vessels.
