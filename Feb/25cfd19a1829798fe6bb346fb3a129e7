A Nigerian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft, on Monday, made an emergency landing at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos.  LEADERSHIP gathered that the aircraft, a Cessna Citation CJ3, which was on a routine flight to Ilorin, Kwara Stats, lost its tyres.  The incident, however, forced the aircraft to land on its underside without the aid of a landing gear.  According to reports, the aircraft crash-landed on Runway 18R with six passengers onboard. Fortunately, there was no any casualty.  “It had a landing gear problem, meaning the tires refused to come out for landing. The pilot landed the aircraft on the bush, a smart move,” a source said.  Confirming the incident in a press statement made available to journalists, the spokesperson of the Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Wap Maigida, said the aircraft carried out a ‘controlled belly land’, with no causality was recorded.  Maigida said, “A Nigerian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft, a Cessna Citation CJ3 on a routine flight today, 6 February 2023 lost its tyres on touch and go flight in Ilorin and had to carry out a controlled belly land at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. Fortunately, there were no fatalities or injuries to any crew member or persons on the ground. ”  He noted that the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, had set up a committee to investigate the incident.  Maigida added, “The Chief of Air Staff has directed the immediate constitution of a Board of Inquiry to determine the cause(s) of the accident.  “The NAF continues to solicit the understanding and support of the general public as it daily strives to ensure the security of Nigeria and Nigerians.”
