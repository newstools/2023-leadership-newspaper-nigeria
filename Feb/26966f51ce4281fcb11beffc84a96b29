 The Ohanaeze Ndigbo has  urged  people of the South-East to resist the sit-at-home order during the forthcoming elections. The group also urged the South-East and Nigerians to vote for Peter Obi to enthrone credible and competent leadership in the country. Ohanaeze made the calls in a communique signed by its national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, at the end of an emergency meeting of the group’s National Executive Committee in Enugu at the weekend. The meeting was presided over by the secretary general of the group, Amb. Okey Emuchay. The Ohnaeze spokesman said NEC had elaborated on a few issues of national interest and reached some major resolutions. He stated that most worrisome among them was the sit-at-home and total lockdown order to the Igbo by one Simon Ekpa, who is based in Finland. He said, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo expresses shock and doubt that a true Igbo would unconscionably embark on a disingenuous duplicitous adventure aimed at denigrating, disenfranchising and decimating his people. “The most disturbing is that the unscrupulous sit-at-home and total lockdown order by Ekpa fall within the Nigerian general elections. “Ohanaeze stands firmly on natural justice and equity to proclaim that it is the turn of the South-East of Nigeria to produce a president and by the irrevocable forces of providence. “Right-thinking Nigerians and the global community have embraced the virtues of Peter Obi as the most suitable, competent, visionary, inspiring and energetic presidential candidate in the forthcoming election. “It is therefore strange that at the very rare consensus and convergence of history, equity, public consciousness and expertise in Obi, an impetuous youth will engage in an unreflective drum-beat that draws his people to a macabre dance. “We are urging residents to disregard the rumoured order making the rounds by Simon Ekpa and that IPOB is only interested in the unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.
