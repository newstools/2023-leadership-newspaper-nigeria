A socio-political group committed to the protection of the rights and privileges to the Ijaw Nation, Movement for the Survival of Izon Ethnic Nationality in the Niger Delta (MOSIEND) has commended the leadership of the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) for its humanitarian and infrastructural development initiatives in the region. Rising from its four-day leadership workshop yesterday in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State leadership of MOSIEND commended the oil and gas regulatory agency for supporting peace initiatives in the zone. Addressing the forum, MOSIEND president, Kennedy West, said “the Ijaw group is working to bring down the red flag profiling of the region.” He said, “It should however be stated here that the hostile response of the Nigerian state to the valid agitation of the peoples of the Niger Delta sparked the eruption of violence in the area. “Since there is time for everything, the leadership of MOSIEND holds the view that it is high time we began a new approach for addressing issues in our region.  “With the lessons we have learnt so far, MOSIEND is pushing for extensive and robust community engagements to prepare them for a new model of achieving their socio-economic, political and environmental quest.  “Our goal is aimed at re-orienting, repositioning, and recovery of the loses of the oil-bearing communities.  “We are hoping to leave behind us an enduring legacy of greater cooperation, purposefulness, and pragmatism in the handling of the advocacy issues in our region.”
