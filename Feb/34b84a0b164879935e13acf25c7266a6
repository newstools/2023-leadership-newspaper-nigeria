The Ebonyi State government yesterday distanced itself and the Ebubeagu Security Network (ESN) from the attack on the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Prof Bernard Odoh. In a joint press briefing yesterday at the Old Government House, Abakaliki, the state commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Barr Uchenna Orji and the security consultant to the state government, Chief Stanley Emegha maintained that the alleged attack was a false alarm. Barr Orji noted that the state government will soon institute a legal action against the state publicity secretary of APGA, Mr Chibuike Nwancho over the comment credited to him that the attack was carried out by the ESN. He noted that the state government would no longer fold its hands and allow its name to be dragged to the mud by opposition parties adding that “there have been several attacks on the APC supporters, yet we haven’t accused the PDP or APGA of being responsible.” The commissioner said that the APC is focused on its campaign and would not be distracted by the antics of opposition parties whom he said are scared of imminent failure in the forthcoming general election. Meanwhile, the Ebonyi State Police Command yesterday said that investigation has commenced on the attack and vowed to fish out the perpetrators of the attack on the APGA gubernatorial candidate. A statement by the PPRO, SP Chris Anyanwu said, on getting the report of the attack, men of the command rose to the occasion and mobilised its tactical teams to assist the Ishielu Divisional Police team in a hot chase of the hoodlums.
