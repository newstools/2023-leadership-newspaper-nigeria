 The Presidency has denied rumours of interim government being planned to be foisted on the nation by President Muhammadu Buhari after his exit from office on May 29. A statement signed by presidential media aide, Garba Shehu, on Friday, alluded to a quote from Joseph Goebbels, the propaganda Chief of Adolf Hitler, who said: ‘‘Repeat a lie often enough and it becomes the truth’’, saying this was in the 1930s, before the internet was birthed. Shehu in the statement added: “let us clearly, specifically and emphatically state that there is absolutely no truth to the claim that President Muhammadu Buhari is working towards an interim government or even worse, the truncation of democracy- democracy that he has helped to keep alive not only here at home, in West Africa but throughout the continent.” According to him, the talk of interim government and truncation of democracy was way off the mark. He said those who peddle it stand to gain nothing at all but the creation of panic and the incitement of the public against the federal government. “It is another dangerous dimension by people who are afraid that they may lose their elections. “Everybody is aware that there is a lot of pressure on everyone-all of us- the party, its elected officials, its candidates and law enforcement agencies following the way the currency swap has gone but the way to go is not to panic. “There is indeed a problem and nobody will pretend that it doesn’t exist. “It is precisely because the President is concerned with this problem that he opened several avenues for consultation with leaders and groups across the country, culminating in his broadcast to the nation on Thursday morning. “In line with the speech, his clear and unequivocal directive is that the problem of cash supply must be addressed without delay,” he stated. While this is being done, Shehu noted that there was no need to panic. “We need to work together as leaders; as a people and as one nation. When panic hits, people go into overdrive. Shouting helps no one because no one can listen,” he said. Shehu further said the solution to the problem was not in sending Nigerians into confusion, reiterating that the upcoming 2023 elections will hold and Nigerians will vote for the “All Progressives Congress (APC) (and any others if they so wish) on the basis of their choice. “Our people want progress, good governance, law and order and will not be swayed by the negative energy that is being expended against a well-meaning currency change. “Finally, to state that: the President clearly has a favoured successor in Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is not in doubt. “The fact that Tinubu has been opposed to the speed and timing of the Naira swap timetable does not mean he is against the idea of Nigeria becoming a cashless society. Of course, Tinubu does support a cashless society: for he is a man of the future. “What should be made crystal clear to the doubters and the speculators and the untruth-tellers is that in no way was the naira swap “engineered” to keep the President in office beyond May 29. Nothing could be further from the truth. “The President looks forward to handing over the reins of power to his elected successor. This will happen on May 29, 2023 as the Constitution requires it. “The days of unelected Nigerian leaders, and those who outstay their welcome by unconstitutionally extending it, have gone,” he stated.
