Reigning NPFL champions,Rivers United,will face off with Motema Pembe,in matchday three,of the CAF Confederation Cup. Rivers United lost their first match against Diables Noirs by 3-0,but defeated Asec Mimosa by the same margin in Nigeria. The Pride of Rivers needs to be at their best to avoid another defeat on the road in the competition as they will also face DC Motema Pembe on day four on March 8. A minimum of four points for Rivers United over the double headers will surely boost their chances of qualifying from the group as DC Motema would be left with only three points after matchday 4 while Rivers United will be riding on 7 points. They will need a win out of the remaining two matches ( away to Asec Mimosa and at home to Diable Noirs) will berth a quarter-final ticket. But Rivers United is faced with a very difficult opponent in DC Motema Pembe as the Congolese side has proven to be a very difficult opponent to beat. DR Congo is yet to lose any game in 2023, a run that included two draws in the CAF Confederation Cup group stage and four other victories in the domestic competitions played this year.
