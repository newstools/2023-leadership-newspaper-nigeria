Amid speculations of his defection to another party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairman in Niger State, Haliru Zakeri Jikantoro has said he will not defect nor engage in anti-party activities that would jeopardise the chances of the party in the state. While admitting yesterday that some of his associates defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he maintained that they were merely pursuing their interest. He said APC is “good to go despite the challenges which made light of the party’s popularity to be dim a little than in 2015 and 2019 but the party will come out victorious at the general election “I am not planning to defect to any party but I am in APC as the chairman” adding that the rumour that he met with presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar was false. “In my life, I have not met Atiku one on one. I got the message while on the way to Saudi Arabia that I engage in anti-party activities. I came back on January 14 and joined them in political activities. I have my interest in the Borgu federal constituency. I’ve fortified my interest, and other groups have their interest, too. So, because some people took the decision to go could not have reflected my interest; we are good to go in APC,” Jikantoro declared. He said people should be able to find out why some of the said associates defected before drawing the conclusion saying that “it is all about interest. We have achieved 70 percent of the reconciliation process in Niger State and that is good enough.”
