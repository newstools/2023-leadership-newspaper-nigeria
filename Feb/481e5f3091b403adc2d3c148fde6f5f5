Dr. Geidam Bulama, a Principal Medical Officer (PMO), who was held captive by the Islamic State of the West African Province (ISWAP) terrorist group, has been released.  Bulama was abducted on March 18, 2022, when the terrorists invaded Gubio local government area of Borno State, located about 70km from Maiduguri, the State capital.  It could be recalled that during the abduction of Bulama, the insurgents had promised his wife that they will not kill him.  Sources said that the insurgents took Mr Bulama and other abducted victims to the fringes of the Lake Chad Tumbuns where he was forced to treat wounded fighters and their families for several months.  The sources in the Lakechad said that efforts of the state government and the security agencies led to the release of Dr. Bulama.  A source said Bulama was released in Gubio, before he was moved to Maiduguri where he was reunited with his family.  The sources did not disclosed if ransom was paid before his release or not.
