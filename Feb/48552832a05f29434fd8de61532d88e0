Nigeria’s Flying Eagles will hope to get back on track in the ongoing Africa U20 Cup of Nations as they battle host nation Egypt Wednesday’s night at the Cairo International Stadium for their group A match. The seven time champions fell to the Junior Teranga Lions of Senegal 0-1 on Sunday in the opening game but still stands a chance of qualifying for the quarter-final stage of the competition. Coach Isah Ladan Bosso will likely be without midfielder Daniel Daga, who was substituted against Senegal due to injury he sustained during the encounter. The result of the scan examination expected later today will ascertain the extent of injury. Despite the loss in the opening game, the Flying Eagles are upbeat they can upset the host nation and put their campaign back on track, as a win will put the team in good stead to qualify for the last eight. The Flying Eagles boast of a rich pedigree in the competition with seven titles to their name while the Egyptians have won it four times. The Young Pharoahs’ game against Mozambique ended in stalemate on opening day and the host nation has only one point and will battle the Flying Eagles hard for the three points inside one of the biggest football arenas on the continent. Nigeria and Egypt last met in the semi-final stage of the Africa U20 Cup of Nations with the Egyptians taking the day by two goals to nothing.
Kick-off time for Wednesday’s game is 7pm local time (6pm Nigeria time).
