Elections in some Wards, according to the Returning Officers (ROs), did not hold because of violence especially in Ikono, Etim Ekpo, Ini and other LGAs, where cases of snatching of BVAS and killings were reported by the ROs. Results of the remaining 10 LGAs were yet to be declared at the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, the immediate-past Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the Akwa Ibom North-West election to return to the Senate.
