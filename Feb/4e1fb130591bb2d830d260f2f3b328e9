Ibadan-based ace musician, Yinka Ayefele, has debunked rumour of his death, which went viral on the social media, especially TikTok. The musician who described the news as fake on Tuesday evening, urged members of the public to ignore the fake news, saying it was the handiwork of fifth columnists who detest success or have other ulterior motives but which will never materialise. Ayefele, who personally attended the Oyo State Governorship Debate organised by one of his radio stations Fresh 105.9 FM, Ibadan, on Sunday evening, said enemies of success would stop at nothing to cover light with darkness, a mission he stressed will forever be a mirage. He described the news as evil, wondering why anyone will wish other mortals nothing good but death. “I was shocked to the marrow seeing on social media videos showing RIP on my photo with a dirge playing to accompany it. It was as devastating as disheartening “It may be common for man to wish another dead in their mind. But when such evil thought is elevated to the mass media with audacity, it exposes downright inhumanity and determination to see a sudden and sad end of a thriving life. “I will, however, like to remind all that my life is in the hands of God, my maker. He has been the cornerstone of my life, hence I enjoy divine peace. “I advise these faceless traducers to desist from their evil machinations. “I also enjoin all my fans, friends and well-wishers not to panic because I am alive, hale and hearty. God is my source, strength and my shield; and He will forever be,” Ayefele stated.
