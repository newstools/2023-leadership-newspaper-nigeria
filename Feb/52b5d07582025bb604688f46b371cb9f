The Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Obi has reaffirmed his resolve to transform Nigeria from a consumption to production country if he emerges president. He stated this when he took his campaign to Anambra industrial hub, Nnewi yesterday, a statement by the Obi-Datti media team said. The statement added that Obi, who was received by the community leaders, including their traditional ruler, Igwe Orizu 111, told the people that he didn’t  come to campaign because Nnewi is already converted but that he urged them to try and convert others in this all-important project of rescuing our country. The former Anambra State governor said in all his political journeys, Nnewi has always supported him massively and he’s therefore certain about their support this time around. He said the town fits very well in the consumption-to-production policy of his manifesto because they are already producing and will therefore play a critical role if he is elected into office. “The high point of the Nnewi trip was the visit to the Palace of Nnewi king, Igwe Kenneth Onyeneke Orizu111, the traditional supreme ruler and Spiritual leader of the Nnewi Kingdom who publicly prayed for Obi and assured him of his blessing and support. “All the top red cap chiefs of the town and other leaders were on hand to receive the LP flag bearer and his team that included the former Minister of Finance, Nenadi Usman, a son of the soil, former speaker of Anambra state House of Assembly, and Director Of Mobilization in Obi-Datti Campaigns, Hon. Benchuks Nwosu and other leaders of the party. “As it has been in all the places he visited, an organic crowd of obedient supporters shut down the city chanting various support songs to show their solidarity for the project that he is leading,” the statement said.
