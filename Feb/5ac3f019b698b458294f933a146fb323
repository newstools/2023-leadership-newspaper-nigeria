The Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL, will proceed on a three-week break at the halfway mark of the abridged league format after this weekend’s match day nine matches. The break will enable the clubs to refresh and make the players and officials to participate in the General Election 2023 scheduled for Saturday, February 25 and March 11 2023. “Yes, I can confirm that the NPFL will go on break for three weeks after the match day nine games. We’ll resume after the Nigerian elections for the final stage of the abridged league, ” Davidson Owumi, Head of operations of the Interim Management Committee IMC said. “We are putting every effort to ensure that the league drives itself. It’s been hectic, but I think we have done well and if we get more sponsors and partners, the clubs and other stakeholders will benefit from it and the league will progress to the level we envisage.”
