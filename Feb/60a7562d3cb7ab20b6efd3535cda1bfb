Arsenal’s deadline day January signing Jorginho scored his first goal for the gunners in a six-goal thriller at Aston Villa.
Jorginho’s shot deflected in off Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez to put Arsenal 3-2 up before substitute Gabriel Martinelli raced clear to score as Villa chased an equaliser.
The Victory ended Arsenal’s run of three games without a win. There was an electric pace to the game from the off, and Villa took the lead inside five minutes through Watkins’ fourth goal in as many matches.
He caught Arsenal cold on the counter, latching on to Matty Cash’s long pass before beating William Saliba and finding the far corner. It took only 11 minutes for Arsenal to respond.Moments after Tyrone Mings cleared Eddie Nketiah’s shot on to the crossbar, Saka levelled with a powerful effort into the roof of the net. Coutinho, making his first league start under Villa boss Unai Emery, put the hosts back in front, rounding off a wonderful team move with a calm finish from inside the area.
On the hour Zinchenko found space at the edge of the box and fired in at the near post from a short corner for his first Arsenal goal, before Nketiah fired over minutes later. Martin Odegaard shot wide with 14 minutes remaining and it looked as though it would not be Arsenal’s day until Jorginho and Martinelli’s vital contributions. Villa sit in 11th in the table after a third straight defeat.
