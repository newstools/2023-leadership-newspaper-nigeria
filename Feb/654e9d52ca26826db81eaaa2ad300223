 The Coalition of South East Youth Leaders, (COSEYL) has noted that several people are dying as result of the implementation of the new naira policy. President-general of the group, Hon. Goodluck Ibem also criticised  President Muhammadu Buhari for ordering that only N200 should be accepted as legal tender till April 20, 2023 while N500 and N1000 notes cease to be legal tenders according the earlier directives of the Central Bank of Nigeria, describing the action as  disrespectful of the Supreme Court. He decried the scarcity of the nation’s currencies as a result of the new policy which he said had thrown many people into hardship. He said; “Presently, so many people have died as a result of hunger and starvation; some died on bank and ATM queues, some were killed by security agents’ stray bullets during protests. “Some (people) stripped naked in banks because of inability to access their cash to eat and solve personal problems. All these and many more are what should be considered when running the affairs of the nation.” The COSEYL leader said because of the ne naira notes, President Buhari had proved again that he has no respect for the rule of law and pronouncements of the courts. “Partial obedience to court judgement is no obedience. The Supreme Court judgement says N200, N500 and N1000 should be allowed to circulate as legal tenders,” he said.
