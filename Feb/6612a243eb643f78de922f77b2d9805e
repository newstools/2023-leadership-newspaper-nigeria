The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Kaduna State Chapter has oommended President Muhammadu Buhari for insisting that the 2023 elections must be free and devoid of vote buying.. CAN also thanked the president for the 10 days extension of the deadline for the old currency to lose its legal tender status. However, CAN called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to do everything possible to make the new naira notes circulate to end the stress being faced by the Nigerian masses in accessing the new notes. A statement issued by the Kaduna State chapter chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab said, “Notwithstanding CAN believe that despite the temporary pains Nigerians face, the citizenry is prepared to support the President on the matter of the deadline, especially if it would assist to ease the tension in the country. “Therefore, managers of banks who are found to hoard the new naira note to create artificial scarcity, but are behind the public arena helping money-bag politicians to get the new notes, set the public up against the CBN’s new policy. Such banks and bankers should be investigated, and if found culpable be made to face the wrath of the law.  “Nigerian citizens are yearning for the best and should not be made to suffer more hardships. Accordingly, CAN will continue to sensitize and mobilize our faithful to support any program which results could bring about good service delivery for a better nation” he stated..
