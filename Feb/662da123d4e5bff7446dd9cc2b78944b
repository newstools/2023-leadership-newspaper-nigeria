Erling Haaland’s agent Rafael Pimenta has claimed that the forward has the “key to the door” whenever he decides his time is up at Manchester City. The Brazilian lawyer inherited Mino Raiola’s empire following his untimely death in April of last year, but has now explained how she had been in charge of every contract in the company client list over the last 25 years. Pimenta also revealed that her clients always have the “key to the door” out of their club, and Manchester City’s star forward Haaland is no different. “I am in favour of freedom. It’s my battle,” Haaland’s agent told Spanish outlet AS. “I always say that one of my priorities as an agent is to offer the player what I call ‘the key to the door’. When a player goes to a club, I do everything I can to create the conditions for the key to the door to be in his hands. And if tomorrow you can’t stand being there anymore because you don’t like it, or you’re not paid well, tjen you leave, right? I don’t like it when my player is not free to decide. I’ve done every contract in this agency for the last 25 years. There wasn’t a single time a player said ‘I want to leave’ and couldn’t do it.” There have been suggestions that Erling Haaland has a Manchester City exit clause that will kick in from 2024 and his agent Rafaela Pimenta has spoken on his future While underlining Haaland’s freedom to leave his new club, Pimenta refused to be drawn on the existence of a €200 million (£175.5m; $194m) release clause. The clause is said to only apply to clubs outside of England, leading many in Spain to believe that this could be the potential exit rout to Real Madrid, who were initially linked with the player before he joined Pep Guardiola’s side.
