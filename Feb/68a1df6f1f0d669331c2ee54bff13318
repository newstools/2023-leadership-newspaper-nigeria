Following his brief hiatus from the music scene, Nigeria’s vocal powerhouse, WANDE COAL makes a long-anticipated comeback with a new single featuring the legendary rapper Olamide, titled “Kpe Paso”, where the incredibly gifted singer combines his inimitable vocal range with Olamide’s flawless wordplay to deliver what can only be described as this artistic masterpiece. Produced by Kel P under Starstruck Management, “Kpe Paso” — a famous lingo from the 90’s, is a fusion of energy, vigor and indescribability in a tune that’s associated with the streets. The black diamond gushes that “the record is about expressing growth in my culture, exposing my culture, going back to the original lingos, connecting with the roots; the reality and values of living in the Yoruba community as a ‘Yoruba demon’”. The new single, released on February 2, 2023, also has its accompanying visuals released same day. Wande coal’s reputation and status as a fan favorite makes sense when you consider he’s produced songs like “Iskaba,” “So Mi So,” “Again”, “Come My Way” and now “Kpe Paso” will join this list as part of his songs that will resonate with his fans worldwide.
