Capital market analysts said, cautious trading is expected on the Nigerian equities market this week. They noted that, in the face of rising inflation and declining rates amidst yields in the fixed income market, portfolio reshuffling to hedge against inflation will continue to favour sectors and stocks with high dividend yields and strong earnings to support high payouts. The market’s upbeat and uptrend nature are expected to be strengthened on the back of corporate actions and earnings of early filers and others in the near term and during post earnings season before the governorship election or after, due to price adjustment for dividend declared.  Analysts Views In the week ahead, analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “we believe investors will be caught between two opposing forces ranging from uncertainties ahead of the nation’s presidential election and the release of 2022 full year corporate earnings with accompanying dividend declarations. “Consequently, we expect more of a choppy theme as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the 2023 general elections scheduled to hold later in the week. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited said: “this week, all eyes will be on the early filers with their 2022 full-year scorecards to guide investor activities. This is particularly true for banking stocks and others with strong fundamentals and earnings that support a higher payout or dividend growth, even as the presidential and national assembly elections inch nearer. “However, a breakout of this oscillating bullish run is expected to be reinforced on the back of corporate actions, increased inflow funds in the equity space, and during the post-earnings season before the governorship election or after, due to a price adjustment for the dividend declared. “However, we advise investors to trade companies with sound fundamentals and, as such, should take advantage of price corrections in line with domestic and global trends.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities The local bourse posted its first weekly retreat in the month following renewed risk-off sentiments by investors. Precisely, the loss recorded on the final trading day, proved sufficient to wipe out the cumulative gains of 0.4 per cent as of Thursday. Consequently, the All-Share Index shed 0.96 per cent week-on-week (W-o-W) to close at 53,804.46. Similarly, market capitalisation shed N280 billion to close the week at N29.310 trillion. Across the sectors last week, performance was largely upbeat for most of the indices that saw support from an increased inflow of funds into the equity space and continued buying sentiments, except for the banking index that was hit with profit-taking, which dragged the index into the negative region by 1.34 per cent week on week. On the contrary, positive price movement was seen in the NGX Insurance index with a weekly gain of 1.18 per cent. NGX Oil & Gas index recorded a weekly gain of 0.91 per cent, NGX Consumer Goods index rose by 0.67 per cent, while NGX Industrial Goods index gained 0.06 per cent for the  week as investors posed their expectations for the early filers from these sectors to start hitting the market with their 2022 full-year scorecards even as the presidential and national assembly elections draw closer.
