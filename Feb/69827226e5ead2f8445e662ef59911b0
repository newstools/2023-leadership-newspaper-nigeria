A support group known as Atiku Critical Economic Sector Workers Organisation, (ACESO) has formally flagged of its campaign strategy towards ensuring that all members of the association vote for the PDP Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the fourth coming general election. ACESO is an initiative of Dr. Titi Amina Atiku Abubakar, working assiduously to ensure that people in the informal sector support Atiku Abubakar massively during the general election. Speaking to journalists in Abuja, the national coordinator of the group, Mr. Chelenye Ekwuru, stated that the flag off is currently going on in all the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT. Ekwuru said that the flag ceremony is part of strategies put together towards ensuring that Atiku/Okowa becomes victorious at the pole, adding that effort has been geared towards victo[1]ry especially as the election is drawing closer. He said, “The flag off is ongoing in all the 36 states of the federation and FCT. We are sensitising our members to be steadfast in their support to the best presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Our members are strongly behind him because we know he is going to make the country better for all. People at the grassroot will definitely benefit from his government when he becomes the president.’’
