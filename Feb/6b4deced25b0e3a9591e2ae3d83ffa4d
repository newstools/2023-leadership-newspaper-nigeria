The Union of Islamic Scholars in Kano have declared endorsing the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar for supporting a Muslim-Christian ticket as against the Muslim-Muslim ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).
Emerging from a meeting in Kano on Wednesday, the leader of the union Sheikh Adam Koki told newsmen that they are impressed with Atiku’s ability to respect the national outlook of the country which is multi religious.
The scholar who sees unity as a very important factor also appreciates inclusivity and describes marginalization of any section of the country as an act of betrayal of trust.
He said they took a critical look at all the contestants and arrived at a consensus that Atiku is not only physically qualified but also the most experienced that can lead Nigeria out of the present hardships having served as Vice president in the past.
“Our reason for endorsing Atiku Abubakar is that he has the experience of having served as vice president in the past and has the better capacity to fix Nigeria judging by the current situation.
“We and our followers will massively vote for Atiku and among us are scholars from various sects that include Tijjaniyya, Izala, Qadiriyya, and even some Muslim elites and businessmen.
“We see this as an opportunity to save Nigeria from religious disharmony and subsequent disunity as embedded in the Muslim-Muslim ticket” he stated. However, he explained that the union has not decided on supporting any gubernatorial candidate in Kano in order to avoid any disagreements and disharmony. “Everyone is free to vote for a candidate of his choice as governor of Kano,” he stated.
