Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has released a short statement after attempted rape and assault charges against him were dropped. Greenwood was first arrested in January last year after police swooped on his mansion. He was due to stand trial in November. The 21 yar-old said: “I am relieved that this matter is now over and I would like to thank my family, loved ones and friends for their support. “There will be no further comment at this time.” It follows a statement from his club where they said they will now “determine next steps” for the player. They added: “Manchester United notes the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service that all charges against Mason Greenwood have been dropped. “The club will now conduct its own process before determining next steps.” Greenwood’s name has remained on Man Utd’s first-team squad list on its official website.
