A voter said to also be a polling unit leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ojochenemi Akayaba, was on Saturday killed in Anyigba, Kogi State during the 2023 presidential and National Assembly elections. An eyewitness claimed that Akayaba was not a ballot box snatcher as widely reported. According to the said source, he was stabbed by a soldier after a security personnel invited soldiers to the polling unit to intervene in the ensuing violence during voting at the unit. “The reason he was stabbed by soldier is not known yet,” he added. Meanwhile, another account said the deceased was gunned down because he tried to snatch a ballot box. “He is known as Ojochenemi Akayaba, he just finished his NYSC service few days ago,” the eyewitnesses added.
