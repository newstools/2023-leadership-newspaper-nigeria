Egypt winger Mohamed Salah would be willing to leave Liverpool in the summer if the club fail to qualify for next season’s Champions League.
Liverpool are experiencing a miserable season and the Reds could not be blamed for looking ahead to the next campaign with many changes expected at Anfield.
Jurgen Klopp is planning to add at least two midfield stars in the summer as that area of the pitch has been a weak point for his side this season. Borussia Dortmund’s Jude Bellingham is the main target for the German coach but whether he is willing to join without Champions League football remains to be seen.
Qualification for Europe’s biggest competition could have a big impact on Liverpool’s squad planning as according to Fichajes, Mohamed Salah would be willing to leave the Merseyside club in the summer should the Reds fail to qualify for the Champions League.
