Justice Nicholas Oweibo of the Federal High Court in Lagos, on Wednesday, ordered the temporary forfeiture of 14 properties located in Lagos, Abuja and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) linked to the Kogi State governor, Yahaya Bello, to the federal government of Nigeria. Justice Oweibo also ordered the seizure of N400million allegedly linked to the State and recovered from one Aminu Falala. The Judge granted the orders after entertaining an ex-parte application brought before him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). While moving the application, the EFCC counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo (SAN), claimed that the properties, including the one in the world’s tallest building, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, UAE, were reasonably suspected of having been derived from unlawful activities. Oyedepo also informed the Court that the N400million was reasonably suspected of having been derived from an unlawful activity and intended to acquire Plot No. 1224 Bishop Oluwole Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. The Judge, however, directed the anti-graft agency to publish the order within 14 days for any interested party to show cause why the forfeiture order should not be made permanently. Details Later…
