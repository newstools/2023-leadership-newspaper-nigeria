The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Rivers State, has adjourned the collation of results of the presidential election over alleged threat to life of the state collation officer, Professor Charles Adias. Adias, who is also the Vice Chancellor of the Federal University, Otuoke, Bayelsa State, announced the adjournment while addressing journalists at the Collation Centre in Port Harcourt on Tuesday. The state collation officer alleged that his life was being threatened by unnamed supporters of political parties. Election Results Have Been Compromised, Says Labour Party Efforts made by the the Commissioner of Police of the Presidential Election in Rivers State, Aderemi Adeoye, to prevail on him to reveal names of those threatening his life, failed. The state collation officer insisted that he wonâ€™t proceed until the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Johnson Alalibo Sinikiem, addressed some of the issues those threatening him raised including the faulty Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS). So far, results from 21 local government areas have been collated, while results from Obio/Akpor and Degema local government areas were being awaited.
