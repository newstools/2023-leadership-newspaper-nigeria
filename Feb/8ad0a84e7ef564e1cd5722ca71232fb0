Manchester City shrugged off the uncertainty caused by a series of Premier League charges to close to within three points of Arsenal at the top of the table with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa on Sunday. A cloud is hanging over the English champions after the Premier League hit the club with more than 100 charges alleging breaches of financial rules dating as far back as 2009. If found guilty, City could face a severe points deduction or even relegation from the top flight. But City boss Pep Guardiola came out swinging in defence of the club’s hierarchy as he pointed the finger at jealous Premier League rivals for the accusations and his players followed him with a show of defiance on the field. Rodri, Ilkay Gundogan and Riyad Mahrez all struck before halftime at the Etihad to edge ominously into Arsenal’s rear-view mirror ahead of a clash between the two on Wednesday. Arsenal still have a game in hand, but City will now move to the top of the table should they win at the Emirates in midweek. The Gunners’ 1-1 draw at home to Brentford on Saturday opened the door for City and unlike last weekend, when the defending champions missed the chance to pounce with defeat away to Tottenham, this time they made no mistake. Guardiola also learned his lesson from an experimental line-up at Spurs. Ruben Dias, Aymeric Laporte, Kevin De Bruyne and Gundogan were restored to the starting line-up and City looked much more like their old selves. The City support made their feelings known before kick-off as the Premier League anthem was booed and a banner raised saluting the lawyer the club have hired to defend the charges. Just four minutes in they had something to cheer as Rodri rose highest to power home a header from Mahrez’s corner.
