Former chief of staff to Abia State governor, Chief Okey Ahiwe has been elected as the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the state. Ahiwe emerged Saturday at the special 2023 PDP governorship primary election at the Umuahia Township Stadium, Umuahia. The election followed the death of the former candidate, Prof Uche Ikonne, who died on Wednesday, January 21 at the National Hospital, Abuja. Ahiwe polled 469 votes out of the 516 cast to beat the deputy governor, Sir Ude Oko Chukwu (12), Mayor Lucky Igbokwe (12) and Dr Sampson Orji who scored 11. A one-time chairman of the party in the state and Third Republic senator, Emma Nwaka scored nil while 12 were declared invalid. Chief Bob Ogu, the former commissioner for Works, Hon Eric Opia and Mrs Ezinwayi Jonas had earlier announced that they were stepping down for Ahiwe. In his acceptance speech, Ahiwe thanked the leadership of the party for ensuring his emergence through a consensus within the three zones of the state.
