An hour later, another girl was pulled out of the rubble, and she was also alive. These are the rare moments of joy here. “This city has seen so much that it needs some good news, and it also gives a spark of hope to the families.” Serdar said several bodies were taken from under the rubble at the same location. “They are probably from the same family,” he said.
