Flying Eagles coach Ladan Bosso has assured that his team will improve on their mistakes from their 1-0 loss to Senegal and qualify for the knockout rounds of the 2023 Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations. Seven-time champions Nigeria were looking to begin their U-20 AFCON on a good note when they took on Senegal. However, it was a very disappointing display from the Bosso’s boys as they managed just one shot on target against their West African ivals. Speaking ahead of Wednesday’s second match against Hosts Egypt, Bosso is confident that his team will learn from their mistakes and qualify for the next round. “We take advantage of tournaments like this in order to develop our level and work to fix our mistakes,” Bosso told cafonline.com “In the end, I trust the team and their ability to qualify for the next round, and that we will achieve our biggest goal, which is to reach the World Cup.” The young Pharaohs drew their opening game against Mozambique, and they will be desperate to get a win which Bosso is fully aware of the threat. “The next match is very difficult, especially since it will be against Egypt, the host country,” Bosso added. “Egypt’s draw against Mozambique will make it more difficult because their desire to win will multiply.” Nigeria have to win their next game against Egypt to stand a good chance of qualifying from their group. The Flying Eagles will square off against the hosts on Wednesday. The competition also serves as a qualification process for the World Cup. Only the four semi-finalists will earn World Cup tickets.
