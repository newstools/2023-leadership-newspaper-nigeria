A group, Exalt Nigeria, has launched a mobile application to mobilise voters and supporters for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr. Peter Obi. The group dedicated to proactively promoting mass participation in the electoral process for good governance has been backing  Obi and his running mate Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed for the 2023 presidential election. It believes that the candidates’ combination is the pathway to sustainable development in Nigeria. The group’s founder, Dr. Idu Nwapa Nwadiaro, said the new app is a technology that enables voters to register by location and support group affiliation. She said, “Verified support groups build their structure and log in their projects by location from national to polling unit, while donors and investors are permissioned to view and fund projects directly at the grassroots level or on a grander scale, as they wish. The OBIDATTIWINS app is available as a web app and for download. “Using its X-factor strategy, Exalt Nigeria 4PO is a location- based meta group of groups congregating all ‘Obidients’ in one location on the same collaborative virtual space, regardless of support group affiliation. Nwadiaro continued, “Elections are won polling unit by polling unit, and what you measure is what you have done. How could multiple support groups in the same area work in parallel for the same purpose? Get in the water everybody and ripple together to make the giant wave that will crest to ObiDattiWins, pun intended!”
