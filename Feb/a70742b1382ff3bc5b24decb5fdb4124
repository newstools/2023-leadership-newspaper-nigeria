LaLiga president Javier Tebas believes other Premier League clubs in addition to Manchester City are guilty of breaching financial regulations. The outspoken Spanish football chief continued to rail against a potential European Super League, insisting it was a way for a select few clubs to control football. English champions Man City were charged earlier in February with more than 100 breaches of the Premier League’s financial rules after a four-year investigation. City said they were “surprised” by the league’s charges, with potential punishments including a possible expulsion from the top flight. Tebas believes that other sides in the Premier League are also guilty of similar offences, speaking after a January transfer window in which English clubs spent heavily. Chelsea broke the British transfer record by signing Enzo Fernandez from Benfica for 121 million euros ($130 million), while English teams’ spending accounted for nearly 80 per cent of all the top five European leagues’ January business. “I criticised Manchester City (in 2017), saying everything that now it looks like they are going to continue to investigate,” Tebas told AFP in Madrid. “I said it then in 2017, so what surprises me is that it takes so long to make this kind of decision, because we are talking about facts from as far back as 2010.  “This is the problem you have in football, that when you detect a problem, some cheating, in this economic case it takes so long to react.”  Tebas does not think the charges will herald a new era of financial control in England.
