Ahead of the February 25 presidential election, a civil society organisation committed to good governance at all levels of government in Nigeria, Coalition for Good Governance Network (C2G-Network), has called on Nigerians to come out en mass to exercise their franchise as an opportunity to renew the country for better. The group particularly called on voters to cast their votes for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, because his campaign manifesto and promises sit well with the quest of majority of Nigerians for a better Nigeria. In a statement jointly signed by the Coalition’s National Coordinator, Michael Musa, and Secretary, Ajayi Olushola, on Wednesday, it said the choice of Tinubu was based on his track records of good governance and talent hunt when he was Governor of Lagos State. “C2G-Network’s verdict is not based on any mundane sentiment. It was informed by a painstaking study of the campaign manifestos and promises of the presidential candidates. “There is no gainsaying the fact that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is more realistic and truthful in his manifesto and promises to Nigerians, hence our verdict that he is right man for the job. “He has a track records of good governance and penchant for identifying round pegs for round holes as lieutenants when he was governor of Lagos State between 1999 and 2007. Ultimately, his campaign manifesto and promises align with the quest of majority of Nigerians for a better Nigeria. “Therefore, a vote for Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on Saturday, February 25, 2023 is a right step in the right direction to renew our hope for a better Nigeria,” the CSO stated.
