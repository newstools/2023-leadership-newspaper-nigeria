Following the failure of the Biomodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS), in many poling units across Anambra State in the ongoing governorship election, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has extended voting till Sunday. The exercise was also extended beyond the closing time of 2.30pm on Saturday. INEC resident electoral commissioner, Dr. Nkwachukwu Orji saidÂ  BVAS failed in many areas because of software breach. According to him, the extension was therefore to enable those who could not cast their votes to do so. Many polling units experienced the breach, thereby delaying the voting process and frustrating eligible voters. For instance, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige battled to vote for nearly one hour and had to leave the voting arena at some point. In his Alor ward in Idemili South local government area, the failure rate was up to 30 percent. Also, the candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Chukwuma Soludo could not cast vote for himself. Although there was massive turnout in Isuofia, his home town, only one person voted in the area. But for presence of security operatives at the various polling stations, many eligible voters would have protested angrily.
