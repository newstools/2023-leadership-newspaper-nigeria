Speaking at the press briefing on Monday in Abuja, the CEO of the non-profit organisation, Mr Kingsley James Awodi, commended the Minister for the initiative that is currently re-writing the history of sports positively in the country. He said, “I just had a meeting with the Minister, and we agreed to key into his initiative the adopt a pitch concept, it’s quite remarkable and we want to key into his dream by using this opportunity to adopt the goal project pitch and fix it.“We are going to present our proposal, and the ministry is going to officially hand over the pitch, that is why we are here today.” When asked how long will it take them to fix the pitch, Mr Awodi said: “We will access the pitch, and we are going to put the best for the pitch, if it’s a grass or synthetic whichever one we are capable of fixing it, it will be ready in a matter of weeks.” Recall that the Adopt a Pitch Initiative which was birthed in 2019 has attracted eminent personalities like Aliko Dangote, Chief Adebute Kensington and other prominent Nigerians to adopt some pitches in the country.
