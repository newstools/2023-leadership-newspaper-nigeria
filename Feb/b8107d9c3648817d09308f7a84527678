The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Kano Municipal Federal Constituency in the forthcoming February 25 elections, Engr. Yusuf Abdullahi Da’awah, has distributed 500 JAMB forms to students from the constituency. The distribution exercise, which took place on Saturday, February 18, held in Kabara, Tudun Wuzirchi Ward in Kano. Speaking during the distribution exercise, Da’awah thanked Allah the Almighty for the opportunity given to him to distribute the forms to the students. Da’awah promised the students that he would sponsor their education if elected member of the House of Representatives in the forthcoming general election to represent the Kano Municipal federal constituency. He said the donation of the JAMB forms has nothing to do with politics, saying he did not know anyone among the beneficiaries. Two of the benefiaries, Umar Muhammad and Zainab Hassan Yahaya, who spoke on behalf of the other students, lauded Da’awah for donating the forms to the less-privileged.
