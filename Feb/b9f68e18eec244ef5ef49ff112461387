Fast-rising Europe based Nigerian musician, Collins Peter popularly known as ‘Kollinz’, has released a new single titled “Man Down” According to ‘Kollinz’, who hails from the South-Eastern part of Nigeria and is the first of five kids in the family,he decided to release the afrobeat song after his hit single “Never Let Go” which he dedicated to Ukraine after the war broke out last year february 24, 2022 Narrating his experience, the talented musician said, “I saw warplanes flying around and bombs landing everywhere, my wife was heavily pregnant at the time and my sister had just arrived few months earlier for her studies. I remember waking them up in the middle of the night when it all started and we had to pack up a few items light enough to allow us run or walk for a long distance if needed, My wife was heavily pregnant at the time and we were worried she might give birth on the road without any doctor or a doctor without childbirth experience. This was a nightmare for me, but luckily we found a train that took us striaght to poland, an experience i wouldnt wish for anyone. Therefore, the song “Never Let Go” was dedicated to Ukraine which was a rap song, but now I am out of the trauma and ready to continue releasing good afrobeat music to the world and “Man Down” is the first of many vibes to come, produced and recorded in Kiev but had to wait one year to release it because of the war. I love music so much and this has now become a major part of my life and my source of income.I have other businesses like real estate, but music is my main source of income and I strongly believe that my calling in life is to heal the world through my music and Africa is the place to start we need to rejuvenate our motherland. No matter what happens I’ll continue to release good music to my fans. Man down is available on all streaming platforms and the video is available as well you can watch it on my channel on Youtube” – He said The young musician, who plans to visit Nigeria soon to work with talented indigenous acts, further disclosed that he will be promoting his album and also establish a record label in his home country. Before now, Kollinz released his first EP titled “Son of Man” in December 2020, becoming a huge success in Ukraine and other parts of the world. He is now set to become a world music star as his second album is ready and will be released later this year.
