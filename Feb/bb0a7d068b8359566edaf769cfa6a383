Capital market analysts expect sustained positive sentiments on the stock market to continue this week as more companies release their 2022 financial year end results on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited. Most of the corporate results released so far are impressive and beat analysts’ expectations. The corporate earnings have given an insight into what the companies’ final dividend will look like, especially the ones that are expected to grow their payout, judging by the earnings per share and established dividend policies.  Analysts Optimism Looking ahead into the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected the current trend of positive sentiment to sustain its grip on the market on the back of more audited earnings expectations and election uncertainty. “However, we advise investors to trade companies with sound fundamentals and, as such, should take advantage of price corrections in line with domestic and global trends,” Cowry said. Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “in the subsequent weeks, we expect the NGX to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish 2022 full year numbers, which will be accompanied by dividend declarations. We believe this should provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk-averse investors are likely to remain cautious due to medium-term expectations of an uptick in FI yields. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest Limited stated that, “this week, we expect the positive performance to be sustained as investors position ahead of dividend payment season amid unattractive fixed-income yield.” On market outlook, the chief operating officer of InvestData Consulting Limited, Mr. Ambrose Omordion said: “we expect positive sentiment to continue on position and profit taking as portfolio rebalancing in the midst of impressive corporate earnings and divergence in fixed income rates and MPR, on more audited earnings expectations and election uncertainty. “Any pullback at this point may add more strength to upside potential. As such, investors should take advantage of price correction. Also looking at the trends and events across the globe and domestically.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities The domestic stock market consolidated the gains recorded in the prior week as bargain-hunting dominated activities during all trading sessions of the week.
