A Federal Hight Court sitting in Lagos State has remanded the actress identified as Oluwadarasimi Omoseyin in jail for trampling on the recently designed naira notes. The actress’ detention in Kirikiri Prison is pending the determination of her bail application before the Court. On Monday, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arraigned Omoseyin before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke on a two-count charge brought against her. EFCC said that on January 28 in Lekki, Omoseyin tampered with the sum of N100,000 by spraying and trampling on the notes. It said the act is an offense contrary to and punishable under section 21 (1) of the Central Bank Act, 2007. Omoseyin pleaded not guilty to the charges.
S.I Sulaiman, the prosecution counsel, asked the court for a trial date and prayed that the defendant is remanded in the appropriate correctional facility. Responding, Adenike Goncalves, counsel to the defendant, prayed the court to admit the defendant to bail pending the hearing and determination of the case. She also prayed that her client is remanded in EFCC custody pending the perfection of the bail terms if so granted by the court. While Sulaiman submitted that bail is at the discretion of the court, he prayed that in the event that bail is granted, the conditions of the bail term should be such that it would enable the defendant to be present during the trial. The judge deferred the ruling on the bail application to February 15 and remanded the defendant in Kirikiri correctional facility. Omoseyin was arrested by operatives of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Fraud Related Offences Commission (ICPC) on February 1 in Ikoyi, Lagos, and was handed over to the EFCC for investigation. The 31-year-old was apprehended after the video of her spraying and stepping on the newly redesigned naira notes at a party surfaced online.
In the viral video, she was seen flaunting wads of the new naira notes that she claimed she received from her fans.
