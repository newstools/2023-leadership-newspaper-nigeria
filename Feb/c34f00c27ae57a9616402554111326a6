Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler are back in another Murder Mystery. This time the couple Nick And Audrey Spitz are visiting a private island in India to attend the wedding of Maharaja, the godson of the wealthy host that was killed in the first Murder Mystery installment. At the wedding, the Maharaja is kidnapped and replaced with a dead man. The Spitzes had to leave the island for Paris, France in order to deliver the $50 million dollar ransom demanded by the kidnappers for the Maharaja’s release. It’s turned into another hilarious and action-packed adventure for the inexperienced murder solving couple. The trailer which dropped February 31, Aniston and Sandler still has that unique chemistry that spilled over to the success of the first movie, and one dare say, got a bit better at rolling with the paunches – though not too much – to the delight of the viewers. Netizens were abuzz with excitement for the film which no one seemed to have expected but never knew they needed. “The chemistry these two bring to movies is amazing” – Z Henderson. “Oh please, make part 3 already and more. We cannot get enough of Adam and Jen in these movies! So awesome (love emoji).” Alxlee. “Seriously, I never would have expected a second movie to come out but I am soooo hyped”. – Ein Idiotpilot. “Can’t wait!!! Love the first movie. Glad the Maharaja is back. He is as he would say: “MAD HILARIOUS”. The first movie is so entertaining and the cast is one of my favourites. Love, love, love this series! Keep them coming Netflix” – Delcia Garcia. “Netflix really spending their budget on murder mysteries. I’m here for it.” Ahmed Banaga. “Super excited!
