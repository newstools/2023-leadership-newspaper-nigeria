 Enugu East Senator Dr Chimaroke Nnamani has insisted that his suspension by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National working committee (NWC) was ill- conceived and unwarranted. Nnamani stated that his right to fair hearing was violated because he was neither informed of any complaints against him nor was he invited on the matter. He said: “The PDP ‘Penkelemesi’ suspension without hearing is incurably messy and will collapse. “My decision to pitch tent with Asawaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was necessitated by the PDP refusal to comply with its own constitution to wit; that key political offices should at all times be rotated between the South and North to guarantee harmony, peace, fairness, equity and justice. “As it is now, there is no fairness, justice and equity in the PDP because both the Presidential Candidate and the National Chairman are from the same region” “ I am only exercising my right for freedom of choice and association. On this score, I  stand with Tinubu”. Going forward, Senator Nnamani told  the leadership of the PDP to put its house in order pointing out that his suspension by the NWC lacked both moral and constitutional backing.
