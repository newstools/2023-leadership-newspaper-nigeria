 A  bookkeeping and payments solutions company, Dukka  has launched its Point of Sales (POS) terminal solution to the market, in a bid to cater for small businesses in Nigeria and across Africa. According to Dukka, the solution has been designed to enable small business owners to accept all types of digital payment methods, such as; card and bank transfers in-store and online, record sales, and view business performance reports. Speaking at the product launch in Lagos, chief executive of Dukka Limited, Keturah Ovio, said: “our mission is to drive financial inclusion amongst Africa’s small businesses by providing them with the digital technology tools that will enable them to grow to become big businesses tomorrow. “To this end, Dukka’s PoS terminal has been designed to enable small business owners to accept all types of digital payment methods such as card and bank transfers in-store and online, record sales, and view business performance reports.” Ovio noted that the innovation is revolutionary at a time in the industry when the federal government of Nigeria is pushing its cashless policy and unsurprisingly, there has been a surge in the number of business owners demanding the PoS terminals. “Since inception, we have onboarded over 200,000 small business owners across all 36 states in Nigeria, likewise Ghana and some other countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, and the United States, with a significant number of small business owners attesting to the ease of use,” she said.
