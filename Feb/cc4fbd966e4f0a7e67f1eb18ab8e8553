The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Prince Adewale Adebayo has taken a swipe at some of the presidential candidates going to Chatham House in UK to speak or campaign, describing it as misplaced priority and inferiority complex . He stated this during an interaction and unveiling of the party’s manifesto at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPPS), Kuru in Jos. “I am ashamed of that because its make no sense seeing presidential candidates rushing to go and speak to outside audience. I mean people who do not know anything about our electoral system or governance, when we have in place the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies here,” he said. He promised that if elected president of Nigeria he would provide a level playing ground for Nigerians irrespective of where they reside to access health care, electricity , potable water, transportation and good internet. Prince Adebayo further said he would provide qualitative education for everyone, whether in the remote villages or in the urban areas, stressing that educational materials needed would be taken to them in the rural schools like it was in the First Republic. Also speaking, the Director General of NIPSS, Professor Ayo Omotayo said the idea behind the interactive session with the candidates of political parties was to make them know that going to London or any other country to interact with stakeholders is out of place . He stressed that the Social Democratic Party candidate happened to be the first guest on the programme  and assured that others would obliged the invitation that would be hosted before the conduct of the general elections.
