Cristiano Ronaldo recorded the 62nd hat-trick of his illustrious career as Al Nassr thrashed Damak 3-0 away in the Saudi Pro League during the weekend. It was Ronaldo’s second hat-trick in five matches for title-chasing Al-Nassr who top the league standings. The 38-year-old has enjoyed a successful start to life in Saudi Arabia since joining Al-Nassr on a contract worth £175-million-a-year. Ronaldo opened the scoring with a penalty into the top left hand corner, before doubling Al Nassr’s advantage with a composed finish from the edge of the area. His first-half hat-trick was completed with a close range finish, following a cutback from Abdulrahman Ghareeb Ronaldo also secured his second match ball in three games, having also scored four against Al-Wehda earlier this month. He has now scored eight goals in just six games in the Saudi Pro League.
