Despite the upbeat investor sentiment, capital market analysts are anticipating cautious trading this week as post-election developments unravel. The Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited remains upbeat during the 2023 election season in Nigeria and signals a complete change of patterns in the history of Nigeria’s stock market as the positive sentiment and buying interest witnessed across all classes of stocks with a history of dividend payment had supported the uptrend. As equity market investors digest the latest macroeconomic data on Nigeria’s economic performance in 2022 and the lingering cash crunch around the economy, the domestic bourse at the close of the week and ahead of the Saturday presidential and governorship elections, traded at a 16-year high, breaking out the recent resistance levels of 54, 290.84 points on buying pressure in the midst of the uptick noticed in the fixed income market rates and yields.  Analysts Optimism Cordros Securities Limited said: “we believe investors will be focused on the outcome of the highly anticipated 2023 Presidential elections. Thus, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading dominates the trading activities. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Going into the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited expected a mixed and positive sentiments to continue as market players digest Q4 GDP figure of 3.52 per cent even as the results from the presidential and national assembly elections begin to fall in. “Also, the recent uptick in rates seen in the fixed income market at the end of the last treasury bills auction in the midst of corporate earnings expectation, portfolio rebalancing and elections jittery are expected to drive sentiments in the market. However, we advise investors to trade companies with sound fundamentals and, as such, should take advantage of price corrections in line with domestic and global trends,” they said.
