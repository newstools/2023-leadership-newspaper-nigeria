Popular Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, has advised Nigerians to be mindful of religious gathering that only speaks of negativity stating that “God did not create you and envelope you in curses and suffering. God loves you. God is love,” the father of three wrote in his Instagram page.
Dakolo had in the past, in his twitter page urged people to beware of people placing hands on their heads or their children’s head in the name of praying.
