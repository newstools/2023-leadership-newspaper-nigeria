About four weeks to the March 11 governorship elections in the country, the Kano Division of Court of Appeal, on Friday, set aside the judgment of a High Court, which recognised Mohammed Abacha as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kano State. LEADERSHIP reports that the appellate court subsequently ordered that Sadiq Wali, who was earlier recognised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as the PDP gubernatorial candidate in the State, be restored as the partyâ€™s standard bearer for the elections. Mohammed Abacha is the son of the late military Head of State, General Sani Abacha, while Sadiq Wali is the son of a Kano PDP chieftain and former of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Aminu Wali.
