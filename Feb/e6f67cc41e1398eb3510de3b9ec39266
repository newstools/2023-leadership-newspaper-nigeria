The Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, Chief Chukwuemeka Woke, has said that Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has never directed his supporters and followers to vote for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the February 25 elections. LEADERSHIP recalls that there had been unconfirmed reports that Governor Wike directed local government chairmen and leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at the local government and ward levels to vote for Tinubu on Saturday. But, speaking on a radio programme monitored by our Correspondent in Port Harcourt on Wednesday morning, Chief Woke said promoters of the vote-Tinubu claim were not accurate in their public statements. He clarified that leaders of other political parties were the ones wooing Wike based on his competence, capacity and performance in the past over seven years. The Chief of Staff to the Governor stated that the PDP presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, was still sending emissaries to Governor Wike. Woke said: “Let me put it on record; Wike never told Rivers people to vote for Tinubu because of his political relevance. “So, Nigerians are coming to him; Peter Obi, Kwankwaso, Tinubu. Even Atiku has been sending emissaries to him because they know his importance. They know that Rivers people believe in him because he is a governor that performed. “You have been in this State since 1999 till date, which governor will be commissioning projects or flagging off project few days to the presidential election?”
