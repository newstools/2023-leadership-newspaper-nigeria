Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for his actions which he alleged are capable of destroying the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor in an audio comment aired by Express Radio monitored by LEADERSHIP Friday on the current cash scarcity in the country caused by the redesigning of the naira notes alleged that the “president is hell-bent on bringing the APC down.” He said the timing of the redesigning of the currency was wrong, declaring that it should have come before or after election time. He said, “If you look at what is happening now, you will feel like crying. Look at him (president), he contested severally but he did not win until the initiation of a merger (by parties) that saw him winning the election. He spent four years and got re-elected. “But now that he is leaving office, he is destroying the party on whose platform he emerged victorious. For God’s sake, is it proper for you to form a party and destroy it yourself? He said, referring to Buhari. According to Ganduje, the redesigning of the naira was meant to stop the conduct of the 2023 elections claiming that the World Iank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other world leaders have faulted the policy. While pointing out that the policy affects businesses negatively, the governor said it was in view of that that some governors, himself inclusive, obtained a court order from the supreme court to stop the rejection of the old money and threatened that any bank that refuses to accept the old notes will have their certificates revoked in the state. He further alleged that the policy was not only targeted at candidates but was a plot to disrupt democracy and hand over to an interim government to oversee the country like it happened during the era of Earnest Shonekan.
