The convener of The Big Tent coalition and supporter of Obi/Datti presidential ticket, Professor Pat Utomi has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC of frustrating eligible voters from voting by denying them their permanent voters cards (PVCs) despite extension in the date of collection by the commission. Professor Utomi who was at one of the collection centres of the PVC in Oshodi/Isolo local government area Oshodi, Lagos State said he spoke with some of the potential voters, who claimed they have visited the collection centres more than eight times but were told their PVCs were not found, therefore dashing their hope of voting in the forthcoming general elections. According to him, ‘’Others said they were directed from one centre to the other, yet their hope was dashed. Out of over one thousand people that came to collect their PVCs, only less than five percent were able to collect their PVCs.’’ Utomi said the situation is frustrating, adding that there is the need for the electoral body to extend the date further, because from all indications INEC is an accomplice in denying the electorate their civic right. He however, added that, if INEC found it difficult to distribute the PVC it should engage the services of a private agency for the distribution. “This process has been so far frustrated by the presiding officials or whatever circumstances, they can claim they are responsible,’’ he said.
