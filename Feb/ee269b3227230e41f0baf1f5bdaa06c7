 The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has expressed sadness over the now confirmed death of Ghana international player, Christian Atsu. He was one of over 35 thousand reported to have died in the earthquake in Turkey over twelve days ago. CAF in a statement released on Saturday said: “CAF President Dr Patrice Motsepe and African Football Family conveys heartfelt condolences to his family and Ghanaian Football Family.” Atsu had been missing since the 6th February quake that caused the collapse of his apartment in the city of Hatay. His club Hatayspor initially reported he was rescued “with injuries” but a day later that position changed. His death was confirmed on Saturday by his agent Nana Sechere. “It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to announce to all well wishers that sadly Christian Atsu’s body was recovered this morning,” his agent Nana Sechere tweeted on Saturday. “My deepest condolences go to his family and loved ones. I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their prayers and support.” Atsu, represented Ghana 65 times, played for a number of clubs including Everton, Chelsea, Newcastle in England and Porto. At the time of his tragic death, he was plying his trade in Turkey for Hatayspor. Tributed have continued to pour in for the former Chelsea ace who died at 31. Atsu joined the Turkish top-flight side Hatayspor in September 2022 and scored the winning goal in a Super Lig match on 5 February.
