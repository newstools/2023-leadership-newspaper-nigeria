A former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives, Bayero Nafada has expressed optimism that the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar will win next Saturday’s presidential polls. Speaking with reporters in his residence in Gombe, Gombe State, Bayero said the present sufferings in the country caused by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led federal government will lead to the defeat of the ruling party next Saturday. He said of the opposition presidential candidates, Atiku is more formidable and has better chances of winning the upcoming elections due to his national acceptance, structure and political experience. The former deputy speaker alleged that the economic policies of the APC administration like the cashless policy has crippled businesses and inflicted hardship on all citizens which he claimed will force the electorate to vote out the party come Saturday. “It is very unfortunate that we are in this mess at this time, the issue of naira swap. Not only the swap but even in the beginning the change of the currency at this time. I think the banknotes are not supposed to be changed at this time because it is very close to the election period. “During elections, whether in the developed countries or developing countries, you need cash. You need cash for so many reasons, most especially in a country like Nigeria where some filling stations don’t accept transfers. So how do you go around? Even INEC has complained about that. “If you go to villages now, they don’t have food to eat. If you take your ram to the market, a ram that will cost N25, 000, you will be forced to sell it for maybe N15, 000 or N10, 000. They have killed your economy. They are killing the economy everyday. “We have finished our election because Buhari has finished campaigning for us (PDP). People are suffering. How do you expect a reasonable person to go and vote for APC? Is not possible,” he opined.
