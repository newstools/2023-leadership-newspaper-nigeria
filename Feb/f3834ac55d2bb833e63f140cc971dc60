Some political parties in four states in the South-West have collapsed their structures to work for the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu at the poll.
The parties are Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Young Progressives Party (YPP), Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), and Action Democratic Party (ADP), who are members of the South-West Alliance of Registered Political Parties said they decided to collapse their political parties’ structures to ensure Tinubu’s victory in Saturday’s election.
The decision of the political parties to work for Tinubu’s victory was announced by the Lagos State Chairman of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Mobolaji Olusegun of YPP during the Lagos Youth Stakeholders’ Parley organised yesterday by the Office of the Lagos APC Youth Leader at Ikeja.
He was accompanied by Osun State IPAC chairman, Simon Adebayo of APM; his Ogun State counterpart, Samson Okusanya of PRP and IPAC chairman in Oyo State, Apostle Dare Ojo of ADP, who also expressed their party’s decision to collapse their structures and support Tinubu to be the next president of Nigeria. The Lagos IPAC chairman, while speaking on behalf of his colleagues, said the political parties resolved to support and work for Tinubu’s victory in Saturday’s presidential poll because they believed he is the best candidate. “We have all decided to collapse our structures to work for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. We are supporting Asiwaju’s mandate and we are going to work toward his victory as the next president of Nigeria,” Olusegun said. Speaking at the event attended by thousands of youths, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, urged the youths and other Nigerians, especially those who are of voting age to vote for the APC presidential candidate during Saturday’s election, noting that Tinubu is the best among all the presidential candidates based on his antecedents, record of achievements and laudable programmes, which have been copied by many states.
