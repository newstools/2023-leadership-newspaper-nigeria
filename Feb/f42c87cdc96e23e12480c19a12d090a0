Stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State are divided over the choice of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the party’s presidential candidate in the forthcoming elections. This is even as the Benue State governor Samuel Ortom during a town hall meeting in honour of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) Peter Obi asked Benue people to vote “obediently”. At a town hall meeting organised by Benue State Professionals for Atiku in Makurdi, the state capital, the senator representing Benue South, Abba Moro, who urged the people to vote for Atiku in the forthcoming election, described the PDP candidate as the only one to take Nigeria out of its current mess. Moro said even the G-5 governors are divided over who to vote as the next president of Nigeria and warned Benue electorate against being indecisive, adding that Atiku is the only outstanding candidate that can get votes across the six geopolitical zones. The senator also asked the people not to make the mistake of voting people who can boast of leaving billions in their coffers after leaving office, while the people they represent were roasting in abject poverty. “For me, the government money is meant for the people and development of the State in many ways being it Health Education among other necessities of lives to better the standard of living of citizenry, but a situation where your people are suffering and your problem is to leave money in the coffers and be boasting of it, call for many questions yet to be answered, because it does not solve any problem. “In another development, I want all Benue people not to leave the issue of age in supporting any candidate of their choice, because age is also critical when it comes to governance, if one cannot figure out yesterday, there is no way he can provide answers to questions that may arise tomorrow,” he said. Earlier, Prof Iyorwuese Hagher described as immature the sentiments whipped up that Atiku is the same Fulani that have been killing people in the state.
