Presidential candidates in the forthcoming general elections have raised concerns over the spread of unsafe and highly chemicalised foods in the country. The candidates spoke at a presidential town hall meeting on climate change and environmental concerns, themed: 2023 General Elections and the Quest for a Greener Nigeria” organised by CAPPA, Health Of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) and We the People, in collaboration with the University Of Abuja. The candidates include Rabiu Kwankwaso of NNPP, Omoleye Sowore: AAC, Adebayo Adewole of SDP and Dumebi Kachikwu of the ADC. They were unanimous in their agreement that unsafe foods spread across the country is one of the major effects of climate change. AAC’s Sowore said “our parents of old lived long and healthy lives because they did not eat the junk we eat now as food. “The chicken and other things we eat, we don’t know where they come from and what they are made from. “Today, in the FCT, if you eat Fufu, you will have to go back to bed first, it collapses your capacity to function because it has been highly chemicalized.” The candidates called for stiffer measures to ensure that food distributed across the country are safe for consumption and possibly tracked to ensure that the source of bad food substance is known. On environmental pollution, the candidates advocated for a law that allows punishment for environmental polluters while regretting that “the same people who are polluting the environment are also the same people who sit on the round table to discuss environmental pollution.
