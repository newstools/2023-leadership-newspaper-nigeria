We are in constant communication with all the Banks and are assured that they are all doing whatever is within their control to normalise this difficult situation. “We enjoin the banking public to maintain peace, rest assured that BDAN is taking all reasonable steps to influence the structure and mechanisms that should free up bottlenecks and open channels that will speed up the resolution of the crisis,” the group pointed out. BDAN hopes “to count on the public’s patience, understanding and cooperation.”
