The Allied Peoples’ Movement (APM) after its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting on crucial national issues particularly the upcoming presidential election, has decided to adopt the presidential candidate and vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for the February 25, 2023 presidential election.  This is contained in a statement by the national chairman of the party, Yusuf Mamman Dantalle, and made available to journalists in Abuja.  According to the statement, after evaluating the democratic credentials of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, the APM considered it appropriate in national interest to adopt the duo in the forthcoming election.  He said Atiku-Okowa ticket was the best and the only presidential ticket to rescue the nation that has been drifting to anarchy, adding that Nigeria needed a competent, experienced, visionary, resourceful and dynamic leader to resolve its multifarious challenges and chart a new course for the nation in next four years.  He said APM has confidence in the leadership of Atiku-Okowa and will consequently collapse its structures nationwide to campaign for the PDP presidential ticket.  He said the party will, however, contest other elective positions including Senate, House of Representatives, Governorship and State House of Assembly seats across the country.  “APM presented credible candidates for these positions and sure of victory in Governorship and Legislative seats.  “National interest supersedes partisan politics. We must join hands to rebuild our beloved nation and  make Nigeria great again.  “The party urges Nigerians to come out en masse and vote for PDP’s  presidential candidate and his running mate, Atiku and Okowa. The umbrella symbol of the party is big enough to accommodate fellow compatriots and turnaround the destiny of the nation,” he stated.
