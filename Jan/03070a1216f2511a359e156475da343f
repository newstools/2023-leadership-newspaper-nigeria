Presidential candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP) Adewole Adebayo has said the collection of Permanent Voters Card (PVC) is not enough to salvage Nigeria. The presidential candidate, who noted the PVC can be a lethal weapon to self and others, said only through making the right choice based on true facts, sound reasoning and an open mind can Nigeria be safe.
Following widespread complaints from stakeholders and registrants, who are yet to collect their PVCs, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) further extended the deadline for collection of the cards by one week.
The new deadline is February 5. And the collection period has also been extended by an additional two hours and will start at 9 am and end at 5 pm daily including Saturdays and Sundays.
However, while reacting to the extension of the deadline for PVC collection, his twitter handle said, “Go and get your PVC. But don’t kid yourself that a PVC is enough to save Nigeria. It is not.
“It is better to have true facts, sound reasoning and an open, fair mind. That way, one can get a good sense to make the right choices.”
