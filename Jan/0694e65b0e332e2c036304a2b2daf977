Gunmen numbering about 50 have attacked the Spokesperson of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, in his country home of Akokwa, Ideato North local government area of Imo State on Saturday afternoon. Already, Ugochinyere’s uncle, Ikeagwuonu, has been shot dead and several others fatally wounded in the attack. The yet-to-be identified gunmen, who arrived Ugochinyere’s residence in a gestapo style, started shooting sporadically at anything on sight, development which forced people running helter-skelter. The gunmen set ablaze all the vehicles within the vicinity even as thick smoke has enveloped the community. LEADERSHIP reports that Ugochinyere is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Ideator North/South federal constituency of Imo State in the forthcoming February 25 elections. In a terse message he sent out across to human rights groups and his social media handles, he wrote: “Emergency. We need help in Akokwa. We are under attack. My house in Akokwa.. They have surrounded it and opened fire. We are under attack. Help help.” Further, residents from the area have taken to their social media handles to call for help, posting gory images from the scene of the attack. Reacting to the development, Executive Director of RULAAC, Okechukwu Nwanguma, in a message warned that the development was a disturbing news, saying that, “There is high fear that harm may befall people there. This is despite the police security I learnt the guy has. It is a huge danger for election if anything happens to that popular guy.”
