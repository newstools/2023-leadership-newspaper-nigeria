Qatar Investment Authority are willing to consider a minority stake in Liverpool. Liverpool have been described as being in ‘takeover talks’ with officials representing the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). Rumours began to circulate over the QIA last week, with images and news reports from the Middle East being widely shared on social media. No formal bid has been launched for the club or indeed expressions of serious interest to generate high-level discussions, says the Liverpool Echo. Fenway Sports Group (FSG) put the Reds up for sale some two-and-a-half months ago. Since then a host of parties have been linked, with FSG said to be preferring a partial rather than a complete sale. Investment from Qatar has been speculated in recent weeks. Qatar Sports Investment, who own Paris Saint-Germain, have been ruled out despite the group reportedly looking at buying into a Premier League club. It is claimed QIA would be open to a complete takeover of the Anfield outfit or purchasing a majority share. QIA chief executive Mansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud recently admitted that investing into football is something the wealth fund is weighing up. He said: “Football, the clubs and the sport is becoming very commercialised in a way, especially now fans are looking into this as an experience, so they would like to and experience and entertain themselves.  At the same time, digitalisation is becoming very important for this. So, the business model of these institutions is becoming very commercialised and very investment friendly. You will not be surprised if we invest in this. “We have not made up our mind yet but this is a very commercially driven decision that we go through. And again, sports is becoming a very important theme as well, people are engaged more in a sport and digitalisation is making it more attractive to investors.”
