 Private Taxi Owners Association of Nigeria (PTOAN) has commended the group managing director of the Nigeria National Petroleum Limited (NNPL), Mele Kyari for his commitment to resolving the lingering fuel crisis. The group also dissociated itself from the planned mass protest occasioned by scarcity of petroleum motor spirit (PMS) across the country, saying the action would not be in the best interest of the association, the business community and the country. In a statement by the national chairman, Mallam Bala Madaki Tiskea and national secretary, Mr Ayodele Femi, the association said it believes in negotiation and a roundtable discussion on finding a lasting solution to the perennial fuel scarcity rather than embarking on protest that would further disrupt the economy. The association said no government of the day would live to see activities of the nation being paralysed due to fuel scarcity, stressing that “there might be unresolved issues” with the supply chain in the oil and gas industry, which it hoped, time should be given to the federal government to tackle the factors militating against fuel supplies in the country. The statement commended the NNPC group managing director, Mele Kyari and his management for their commitment to reforms in the oil and gas industry, noting that the ongoing reforms would bring a lasting solution to fuel scarcity in Nigeria.
