 A civil society organization, the Crime Victims Foundation of Nigeria (CRIVIFON) has called on the police to investigate and prosecute the management of the two hospitals which allegedly refused to accept Lagos lawyer Omobolanle Raheem for treatment when she was shot by a police officer on Christmas Day in Ajah area of Lagos. CRIVIFON stated that refusal to accept the female lawyer for treatment when her life was in critical condition was in contravention of the Compulsory Treatment of Gunshot and Accident Victims Act of 2017. The foundation stated this in a statement issued yesterday in Lagos and signed by its executive director, Mrs Gloria Egbuji. Egbuji claimed that it was gathered that following the unprovoked shooting of Raheem who was in company of her husband and others in their family car on Christmas by an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Drambi Vandi, she was first rushed to Budo Specialist Hospital where she was rejected ostensibly due to non-submission of police report.  She was subsequently taken to a second hospital, Doren Hospital but no help was forthcoming before she was rushed to Grandville Hospital where she was confirmed dead.  The foundation which was in the forefront for over two decades pushing for a law to checkmate the high incidence of death of gunshot and accident victims due to failure of hospitals to treat them because of non-submission of police report, has urged the Lagos State Government and the police to diligently investigate the circumstances of Raheemâ€™s death when hospitals could have helped save her life.  Though prosecution of the killer police officer commenced a few days ago in a Lagos High Court where he pleaded not guilty, CRIVIFON would want the hospitals to be similarly prosecuted for breaching the Gunshot Act.  It would be recalled that Rivers and Lagos State governments in 2022 domesticated the Gunshot Act thereby making it an offence for any hospital or clinic in the states to deny victims treatment simply on the ground of non-submission of police report.  The inspector-general of police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba has similarly directed police personnel in various states of the federation to comply with provisions of the Gunshot Act as it applies to the police.
