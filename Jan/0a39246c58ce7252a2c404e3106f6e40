A Pan-Northern group, Arewa Democratic Watch (ADW) has claimed that the reliance of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu on governors in the North to win election in the zone will fail. They added that rather than wooing key leaders in the North, Tinubu has been relying on governors to win, which won’t work out for him. The position of ADW was contained in a statement issued by its national coordinator Mallam Ali Komo Musa in Kaduna, who also called on voters in the region not to vote for Tinubu in next month’s presidential election. He said voters in  the North need to be wary of some anti-North sentiments allegedly espoused by Tinubu in the past. “I am using the opportunity provided by this statement to draw the attention of Northerners to their responsibilities ahead of the forthcoming general election scheduled to commence next month. “The call has become so pertinent and auspicious at this time to enable us as a people to make the right and informed choice that would eventually serve our interest in the long run,” Musa wrote. Musa added, “How do you want us in the North to trust someone who had in the past been calling for Resource Control and True Federalism? Don’t forget that he once granted an interview to an influential newspaper in the South to say that he didn’t believe in Nigeria,” he said. The group also faulted the campaign style of Tinubu which he stated is not grassroot based, adding that rather than wooing key leaders in the North, Tinubu has been relying on governors to win, which won’t work out for him. The group called on security agencies to invite the APC presidential candidate for questioning in relation to the so-called Tinubu’s Army which portends a danger to the stability and peace of the country. Usman said, “We must work to ensure that the candidate that would work for the North is elected next month and not a pretender.”
