 The personnel of the state waste management, particularly the street sweepers were on Thursday excited when Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu disclosed that his administration is already working on salary and allowance increment for them. The visibly elated President of AWAMN, Dr. David Oriyomi said the plans of the state governor would further motivate their personnel to perform better. He reminisced that in 1999, when Tinubu became the Governor of Lagos State, he inherited a state which was overwhelmed with waste and labeled one of the dirtiest states in the world. Oriyomi said that Tinubu had the option of bringing a foreign company to manage the waste in Lagos, but chose to empower the people with his famous quotes – ‘’If our people cannot clear their cities, what can they do?’’. Governor Sanwo-Olu while addressing members of the Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria (AWAMN) at a mega rally organised by the union to endorse presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the governor’s re-election bid said plans were afoot to increase their salaries and allowances. Announcing upcoming salary increment to the union members that filled Mobolaji Johnson Arena formerly known as Onikan Stadium to its capacity for the rally, Sanwo-Olu, assured them that their welfare were his government priority because of the role they are playing in the state.  He commended the union for deeming fit to reciprocate the kind gesture of his administration and Tinubu’s initiative which paved the way for the union to contribute its quota to the society.  In his goodwill message, the managing director of LAWMA, Mr. Ibrahim Odumboni said that the rally was an opportunity for the waste managers to appreciate Tinubu and Sanwo-Olu.  Odumboni said that what had become AWAMN today had its foundation solidly laid by Tinubu many years ago.
