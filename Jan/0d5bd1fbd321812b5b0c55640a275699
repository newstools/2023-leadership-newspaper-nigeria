The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State has said that the party has totally accepted to comply with judgement of the appeal court, directing the conduct of fresh election in 11 out of the 23 local government areas of the state, ending the suit filed by Professor Terhemba Shija against the APC gubernatorial standard bearer Rev. Fr. Hyacinth Alia. Chairman of the party, comrade Austin Agada who made the statement in Makurdi explained that the decision of the court had been communicated to the national secretariat of the party who will in turn inform INEC. “As a law-abiding political party, we call on our teeming members and supporters in the affected eleven local government areas to remain calm and prepare for the re-run exercise within the shortest possible time-that INEC would decide. “However, the Benue State chapter of APC is fully aware of the antics of certain moles in her membership who have become willing tools and agents of the opposition to destabilize the party. We encourage our loyal party members to remain focused as the party is poised to defeat both the internal and external enemies in the forthcoming general elections,” he stated.
