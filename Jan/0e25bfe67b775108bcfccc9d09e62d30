 Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni has urged former local government chairmen in the state to work hard in uniting members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and ensure its victory in the 2023 elections. Buni disclosed this during an audience in the Government House Damaturu with the group led by the former chairman of Fune local government area Hon Adam Arjo Kayeri. Buni expressed gratitude to the forum for uniting themselves to move the state and the party forward. The governor, who was represented by his deputy Hon Idi Barde Gubana, promised the visitors that the state government would continue to support the ex-chairmen in their efforts to move the state forward. He said the governor maintained that the former chairmen were competent, committed and experienced grassroot politicians, who played great roles in mobilising people to support the governmentâ€™s activities.  On behalf of his colleagues, the interim chairman of the forum, Hon Adam Arjo Kayeri, told the governor that they were in the Government House to pay homage to him and express their loyalty and support to enable him serve the people better.
