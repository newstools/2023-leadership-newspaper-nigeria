House of Representatives candidate on the platform of the Labour Party, Uche Okonkwo has urged Nigerians to address the leadership crisis in the country by electing the Labour Party candidate Peter Obi as president. Okonkwo, who is contesting for Idemili North and South Federal Constituency, disclosed this during the Labour party presidential campaign in Anambra. A statement by his media aide, Collins Steve Ugwu, quoted Okonkwo as saying “Hope is no longer hopeful, because deceit is their only exchange for our common trusts.” He continued, “Nigeria has had enough baptism of fires of failures and enough broken promises for a lifetime. We have been fed too much lies from men without conscience nor character, men denied their vigour yet insisting feebly to heal the land. “Now is the time for the baptism of life and prosperity so sure in Peter Obi, and very secure in Yusuf Datti Baba-Ahmed. So, I ask and beg you all Nigerian youths and people, to hold fast to your resolve to seize this moment now, and score that winning goal on February 25, through the Labour Party,” he appealed to the applause of the capacity filled venue. Okonkwo who later spoke on his core legislative agenda revealed that Idemili North and South will have evolutionary representation never experienced before, with direct impacts on improved security and crime reduction, youth entrepreneurship through expanded digital learning and skill acquisitions, healthcare for the aged and vulnerable, and wider educational inclusion for all youths in business, farming and tradesmen.
