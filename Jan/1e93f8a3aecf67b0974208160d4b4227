 Former deputy gov’ship candidate on the platform of ruling All Progressives Congress APC in Cross River State, Barr Helen Effiom Boco, has defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) saying it would enable her join hands with other PDP supporters to produce the next president of the country. Announcing her defection to the PDP in an interactive session with journalists yesterday in Calabar, Boco who served as running mate to former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Usani in the 2019 governorship election, said her decision to quit the APC for the PDP is to enable her liberate herself alongside other grassroots supporters who had been working for the APC. “There has been no joy in the APC. We have been waiting for the opportunity to tell them that we have an option. It’s high time we tried another political party. “As a strong stakeholder, I am not a member of the Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) nor included in their campaign organisation. “They don’t involve me in their party activities even when I am a foundation member of the APC. “This is to inform you that I have just been appointed a deputy national coordinator just as Atiku Abubakar constituted an independent campaign council for the Atiku/ Okowa project. “My appointment is an independent campaign council for the grassroots. Our responsibility is to convince people to join the movement for support of the Atiku/Okwa presidential ambition. Power must change hands.  “After my meeting with our grassroot supporters. As a mother and grandmother while in APC, I won’t move alone but with thousands of supporters. There is just no joy in the APC. I keep using the phrase there is no joy because its the language understood by the grassroot people,” she said.
