The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign rally at the Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Stadium in Bauchi ended abruptly, on Monday, after the microphone on the podium ceased working following a disruption of power supply. The microphone malfunctoned when the APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had barely started making his remarks, which was supposed to usher President Muhammadu Buhari and the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to the podium.  LEADERSHIP learnt that frantic efforts of the engineers manning the electrical equipment of the event were futile, thus forcing President Buhari to merely walk to the stage and presented the party flag to APC governorship candidate in the State, Air Marshal Sadique Baba Abubakar (rtd). Soon after the President presented the flag, his security details immediately ferried him out of the stadium without making any speech, a development that caused commotion in the facility. Similarly, Tinubu and his running mate, Kashim Shettima, left the venue without uttering a word to the crowd of party members and supporters.
