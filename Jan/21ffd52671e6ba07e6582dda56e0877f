DLM Capital Group, a development investment bank, partnered with the Shile Akinjo Charity Foundation (SACF) on two of its charity initiatives: ‘Love Feast on the Street’ and ‘Back-to-School Project.’ Shile Akinjo, a corporate finance associate at DLM, started SACF in 2022 to support low-income families and the less privileged to fight poverty, receive decent health care, and achieve a basic education. The ‘Love Feast on the Street’ was held on the 17th of December 2022 to celebrate Christmas with over 400 kids at Makoko Slum, Yaba, Lagos. The day’s highlights included face painting, a dance competition, popcorn, food, drinks, and the gifting of party packs to the kids. The ‘Back-to-School Project’ was held on the 20th of January 2023, at the Light School and Boanerges School at Akesan, Alimosho, local government. All the pupils in basic 1–5 were given school supplies, such as; school bags, socks, notebooks, pencils, biros, erasers, rulers, crayons, water bottles, and snacks. Shile Akinjo commented on the initiative, stating that, ‘happiness is as essential as food if a child is to develop into normal manhood or womanhood.’ “Being able to put smiles on these kids’ faces is fulfilling, and we will continue to carry out initiatives that support these goals. I am grateful to Mr. Sonnie Ayere and DLM Capital Group for their full commitment to these projects. I feel lucky to work for a company that supports and encourages its employees to do good things for the community,” Akinjo stated. In a statement highlighting DLM’s sponsorship of the projects,, head of Corporate Communications of the firm,  Chinwendu Ohakpougwu said: “at DLM, we are committed to impacting human lives. The management of DLM will continue to support good causes that promote the welfare of others.”
