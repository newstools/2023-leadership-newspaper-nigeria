The Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has advised Nigerians living in Equatorial Guinea to renew their permits if possible, or apply to come back home to Nigeria if undocumented, to avoid sanctions by the government of Equatorial Guinea. According to a letter from the office of Nigeria’s Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the African country has warned all undocumented foreigners to “voluntarily leave the country or face deportation.” Following this threat of sanctions by the authorities in the country, NIDCOM issued a statement yesterday through its head of media, public relations and protocol unit, Abdur -Rahman Balogun, warning Nigerians living in the country of the impending danger if they refused to abide by the country’s directive. Part of the statement read, “A report by the government of Equatorial Guinea on October 17, 2022 was issued, advising undocumented foreigners in their country to leave voluntarily or face government sanction. “According to the report, this is aimed at curbing elements of sabotage and creating stability in the country of Equatorial Guinea.  The letter also stated that obtaining a one or two-year residence permit by foreigners goes between $410 and $620. “As a commission committed to the welfare of its citizens, we advise that Nigerians in Equatorial Guinea should renew their permit if possible, or apply to come back home to Nigeria, if undocumented, to avoid sanctions by the government of Equatorial Guinea.”
