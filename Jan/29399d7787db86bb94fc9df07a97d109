 Troops of Operation Hadin Kai in collaboration with hybrid forces of the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) have eliminated 32 terrorists including a top Boko Haram commander, Abu Illiya, during a raid on the terroristsâ€™ camps in Konduga local government area of Borno State. It was gathered that the troops achieved the feat during an intelligence-led agressive fighting patrols in some identified Boko Haram hideouts in Kayamari, Habasha and Yuwe villages of the LGA. An intelligence obtained from top security sources by Zagazola Makama, a Counter-Insurgency Expert and Security Analyst in Lake Chad, said that the troops made contact with the terrorists in the course of the counter-offensive patrol in Yuwe, which led to a heavy gun battle. The sources said that the troops successfully defeated the Boko Haram terrorists while others fled in disarray due to the superior fire power of the soldiers, thus abandoning their weapons. The troops also destroyed 50 bicycles recovered in the hideouts of the terrorists. The newly appointed Theatre Commander, Joint Task Force, North-East Operation Hadin Kai, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Ali, shortly after taking over command, vowed to sustain efforts towards ending the fight against the insurgents. He said that all hands must be on deck to see to the end of terrorism in the North-East region of Nigeria.
