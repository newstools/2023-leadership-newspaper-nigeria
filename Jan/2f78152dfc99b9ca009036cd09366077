Spokesman of Dakum/ Pwajok campaign council in the state Comrade Nuhu Gagara told newsmen yesterday in Jos that adequate arrangements have been made to receive Peter Obi, his running mate, Datti Baba Ahmed and top shots of the party in Tin city for the much-expected rally. Gagara assured the presidential rally will be hitch-free as adequate security measures have been made by security agencies in the state to control the crowd at the presidential rally. He added that Plateau has become a home of the Labour Party because both APC and PDP have been swept away. He also said the other parties don’t have anything new to offer to the people of Plateau State anymore. “We are expecting genuine crowd of people not hired crowd as every Plateau man is desirous to see Peter Obi at the rally.” The Plateau Labor party Càmpaigns Spokesman noted that Plateau people have turned to Labour party because Lalong regime has performed woefully, adding that “in terms of honesty they are Zero, in terms of integrity you better not mention their names before Plateau people” Gagara stressed.  He added that in 2015 the hallmark of the outgoing APC government campaigns was that they were coming to fight corruption from Buhari down to the Governors and office holders, but today APC is corruption personified .  The Plateau Labour party Càmpaign spokesman added that the people of his state have come to embrace Labour party because they are tired watching APC perpetuate corruption at all levels of government.  According to him, Labour party today on the Plateau has become a Party to beat as both PDP and APC have become spent forces on the Plateau- that nobody is looking at their direction.
