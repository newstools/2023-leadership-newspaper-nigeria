Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has boasted that no amount of propaganda by the All Progressives Congress (APC) would stop the Peoples Democratic Party,(PDP) from winning next month’s election in the state. The governor spoke yesterday at the Government House, Makurdi, during a reception in honour of the party’s governorship candidate, Hon. Titus Uba, who returned after over one-month medical vacation abroad. Uba has been away on sick vacation in Germany where he underwent treatment for partial paralysis. Ortom said the speedy recovery of Uba was an indication that all forces of darkness over the state, the PDP, and spiritual wickedness in high places had failed. He said, “We will win all elective positions in the state including the House of Assembly, Senate and House of Representatives. By the grace of God, Titus Uba will win the coming polls. I will win my Senate election. We will show that PDP is in control of Benue. Where I have not succeeded, Titus will take off from there and succeed.” Earlier, Uba acknowledged the prayers of the party faithful and Benue people and thanked Ortom for his support in ensuring that he received the best medical treatment in Germany. The senator representing Benue North West Senatorial District Orker Jev said “Bob Marley once sang that when the cat is away, the mice dances but today the cat is back and the mice will run for cover. Our governorship candidate is back and the forces of evil have failed.”
