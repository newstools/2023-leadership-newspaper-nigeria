Vanguard Newspapers has bestowed the honour of ‘Personality of the Year’ on the president of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote. The newspaper honoured men and women who have distinguished themselves as achievers of excellence in their various fields of endeavors. Justifying why Dangote topped other prominent Nigerians to emerge as the Personality of the Year, the Vanguard Newspapers stated that, “no Nigerian today has demonstrated more utilitarian determination and unmatched ambition in business than he has. There is no individual referred to as president, whose persona dwarfs that of the presidents of many nations, yet, he is not the president of a nation. He has and continues to represent Africa very well on the global stage.” Vanguard further explained that “for 11 consecutive years, he has been the richest man in Africa, according to both Forbes and Bloomberg and that for him to be in charge of the largest conglomerate in West Africa, he must possess some skills, a high level of intellect, and a capacity to manage people and resources.” It also said: “the group he founded currently has a presence in 17 African countries and is the market leader in cement on the continent. One of the group’s subsidiaries, Dangote Cement Plc, is the largest listed company in West Africa and the first Nigerian company to join the Forbes Global 2000 Companies list. “The group has two other subsidiaries: Dangote Sugar Refinery and NASCON Allied Industries, both listed on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). The Group is diversified and operates in major sectors of the Nigerian economy, including agriculture.” The Newspaper added that, “in the spheres of commitment to serve, drive for excellence, utilitarian determination, philanthropic outreach to help, and contribution to national development, Dangote deserves the honour of being named Vanguard’s Personality of the Year, 2022.”
