 The first Pan Yoruba online media Irohinoodua has named former governor of Ekiti State, Dr Kayode Fayemi as the Yoruba Man of the Year 2022. The publication in a statement signed by its executive editor, Mr Taiwo Adeleye, stated that the former Ekiti State governor won the Yoruba Man of the Year Award 2022 based on three considerations: Development of Education, Security/Regional Integration of the South West and Promotion of Human Rights Ideal. The publication stated that  Fayemi has age on his side adding that with his global network and credibility, he is a potential global leader. Irohinoodua stated that it was significant that Fayemi was by  September last year elected as the president of Forum of Regions in African in the city of Saidia in Morocco under the auspices of His Majesty. King Mohammed VI. Irohinoodua added that Fayemi remains the pioneer of the Laptop for A Child programme which he introduced in Ekiti as far back as 2010. The media group said the result was a distinguished performance in Education in Ekiti, an effort that reclaimed the floundering momentum of a knowledge driven state. It stated that under Fayemi administration Ekiti was rated as number five according to the Multinational Poverty Index (MPI) report released by the National Bureau of Statistics, (NBS) which shows that Ekiti stands above its potential. “We recall that as far back as 2010, he drew up a comprehensive strategy in response to the crisis in the Maghreb region with a futuristic plan to ensure the South West was saved from the spill over.    “The creativity of his ideas was not to be fully reckoned until in later years when Nigeria and the South West began to witness terrorist invasion. He had employed 800 members of the Peace Corps backed with state law which full potential was momentarily halted due to the change of government in Ekiti in 2014.’’
