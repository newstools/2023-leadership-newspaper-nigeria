President Muhammadu Buhari Friday promised to consider the requests for assistance made by the new Governor of Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, who was at the State House in Abuja on a ‘thank you’ visit. The governor, elected on platform of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said he had come to appreciate the President for providing a level playing field in the 2022 governorship election in his State. According to a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, the governor said: “I had waited patiently for this appointment, and was praying fervently for it to happen. It’s a dream come true for me to see you, and have a handshake. “I am a beneficiary of the new Electoral Law you signed, as it paved the way for free and fair elections, ruling out ballot box snatching and stuffing. “The security agencies followed your instruction to be fair and firm, and I am so proud of you. You are a true father, regardless of political party differences.” The Governor said free and fair elections would be one of the greatest legacies President Buhari would bequeath to the country, as the development was already being applauded home and abroad. He gave his priorities in the State as development of agriculture, education, and investment drive. Among requests Gov Adeleke made were; support on infrastructure development, a proposed new economic city and free trade zone, tax credit, and other Federal facilities in Osun State.
