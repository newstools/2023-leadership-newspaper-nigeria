Renowned for classic designs made from the finest of fabrics, Abuja based brand “Rayha Swish Empire” is redefining elegance through taste for quality, finishing and elegant designs in women fashion. The brand owner, Huraira Abdul who went through tutelage of experts in Sokes Fashion Academy in Abuja during her compulsory youth service year to do fashion on a professional level believes in not just selling clothes but experience, and allowing clients to have the feel of how to wear their various pieces. According to Abdul, the feedbacks the brand has received are believed to be based on originality and creativity. As all their designs are original from sketch to production. The brand which caters to women fashion was built with the understanding that every woman is a muse in her own unique way to form the basis of their designs. “So I would say we have met the expectation of women by giving them quality and value for their money. We understand that every woman is a muse in her own unique way and this forms the basis of our designs. “At Rayha Swish our garments are designed with attention to details. They are made from the finest of fabrics: a classic marriage of silk and damask, flattering silhouettes, clean finishing and unique designs. We are redefining elegance through our taste for quality, finishing and elegant designs”. Besides the threatening challenge posed by power supply, Rayha Swish Empire is edging toward being a one stop shop for all things fashion from accessories to dresses for elegant and stylish woman through pieces in virtual look books.
