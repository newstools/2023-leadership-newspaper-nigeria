The Kaduna State All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council has said it will commence its campaign next week Monday as the party released its timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election, covering the 34 state constituencies. A statement signed by the secretary of the campaign council, Malam Yahaya Baba Pate, stated that the campaign will kick off next week Monday, January 16, 2023 in Giwa local government area. The statement promised that APC will run an issues-based campaign, with decency and devoid of mudslinging and name calling, adding that the campaign will be devoid of thuggery and other delinquent and deviant activities. Pate said APC candidates will highlight what they have done in past and what they will do when they are voted into office: “Specifically, our gubernatorial candidate, Distinguished Senator Uba Sani will showcase his stellar achievements as a member of the upper legislative chamber and his sterling record as a presidential aide and Political Adviser to Governor Nasir El-Rufai,” he added. The statement further said that the APC campaign will be a marked departure from what obtains in other parties because it will comprise rallies, town hall meetings and various engagements. Secretary of the council also said that APC will go house-to-house and door-to-door to seek the support of Kaduna voters. According to him, the campaign council and other party members will campaign vigorously, in spite of the caliber of its candidates and programmes. The statement pointed out that APC has been campaigning since INEC lifted the ban on campaigns, adding that next Monday’s outing will be another phase of the campaign. Pate however said the campaign which has 41 components, will end on February 18, with a women summit.
