 The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called a political commitment to building a strong health system, based on primary care, with an emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion. WHO country representative, Walter Mulombo, disclosed this at the 6th Annual Conference of the Association of Nigeria Health Journalists (ANHEJ) in Akwanga, Nasarawa State. Represented by WHO Field Presence Cluster Lead, Ahmed Khedr, Mulombo stressed that the pathway to  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is slim while emphasising the need for leaders to prioritise health for all by ensuring that everyone have access to health. He stated that until something is done,  the negative externalities pose huge losses to the Nigerian economy. „There is no single pathway to UHC. All countries must find their own way in the context of their own social, political and economic circumstances. „But the foundation everywhere must be a political commitment to building a strong health system, based on primary care, with an emphasis on disease prevention and health promotion. Such health systems do not only provide the best health outcomes; they are also the best defense against outbreaks and other health emergencies. In this sense, UHC and health security are truly two sides of the same coin,“ he said.
