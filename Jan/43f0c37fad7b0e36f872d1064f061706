 Ex-BBNaija celebrity, fitness enthusiast and social media influencer, Adeoluwa Okusaga (aka Saga) said he is all about promoting realistic positivity in his activities on-and-offline. In an interview with the LEADERSHIP Books & Arts, the electrical engineer who is currently focused on turning his life-long passion for drawing into a fulltime profession, alongside his influencer role, said he is not only spreading good vibes and poverty energy, but doing so the right way. “Some people like to sell positivity in a non-realistic way. I try to sell realistic positivity. I want people to look at my art and feel good in a real way. “Life is a struggle, even for the so-called rich. But you can obtain a certain feel-goodness when you understand certain principles of life. That is what I am trying to put out.” “You know, being yourself is a problem,” he continued, “everybody wants to be change the way they are. Everybody wants to be someone else. But you can be just the way are, and be good. Because at the end of the day what you have is yourself. You can be yourself and that’s good.” Saga noted that he’s made it a point to remain down to earth and live within his means on and off social media. That has not always worked out in his favour. “Once, in an interview I said the truth about my struggles. It didn’t end well. People still found a way to drag me all over the internet. But I stay truthful to myself.” He, however is determined to be true to himself in order to help others do so too. “Since I left the BBNaija house I have focused on myself. I didn’t live someone else’s life. I don’t try to post impossible things. I wouldn’t post things I don’t have or fake a lifestyle I don’t live. I am an artist. I am a fitness guys, and those are what my posts are about.”
