The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is to spend a whooping N3.64 billion on what it termed as non-tangible assets this year, 2023. This was contained in the Ministry’s budget details for the year 2023 and obtained from the Budget Office of the Federation. According to the documents, the breakdown of the non-tangible assets includes: Research and Development, Computer Software Acquisition,  Anniversaries/Celebrations and Monitoring and Valuation.

The sum of N35 million was budgeted for the rehabilitation and repairs of the Ministry’s water facilities across the country.
