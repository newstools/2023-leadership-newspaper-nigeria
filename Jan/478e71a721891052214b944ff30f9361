The Delta State government has assured that the 2023 edition of the Zenith Bank/Delta Headmasters’ Cup football competition will be another avenue to unearth young budding soccer talents.
Commissioner for primary education, Hon Sunday Onoriode, stated this yesterday in Asaba at a press briefing heralding the event, saying the competition will simultaneously fulfill the exercise needs of the children.
According to him, 4th edition tagged ‘2023 Zenith Bank/Delta Headmasters’ Cup’ was designed to foster the love for sports in the children at a young age as it has shown fruitful results in the past and promises to continue to be pivotal in the development of grassroots sports both in the state and beyond.
“This edition of the competition promises to be an improvement on the past editions as we strive to make the competition more inclusive with participation by public and private primary schools in Delta. The preliminary stage of the competition will run simultaneously across the 25 LGAs of the state.”
“The outcome has been made possible through the commitments of Governor Ifeanyo Okowa and other stakeholders both in the public and private sectors. I also appreciate our sponsors, Zenith Bank PLC, for their continued support and benevolence in sponsoring the competition. This endeavor is worthy of emulation as the bank remains a trustworthy partner in the grassroots sports development industry,” Onoriode stated.
