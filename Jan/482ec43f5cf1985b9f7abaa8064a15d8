Southampton boss Nathan Jones has revealed that  Joe Aribo is still part of his plans this season. Aribo has started only once in the league under the former Luton Town boss and he failed to get on the pitch in each of his side’s last three games. He did play 87 minutes of Saints’ 2-1 FA Cup win at Crystal Palace but that performance hasn’t led to increased opportunities. Jones told the Daily Echo: “We’ve got a lot of midfield players, a lot of people. So we’re just trying to find a balance there where we get the best out of everyone. “Joe has been a little bit of a victim but he’s played well. He came into the game against Crystal Palace the other day and had an impact. “We’ve had a few out, we’ve had a few people come back in, we’ve had a lot of games, we’ve played James Ward-Prowse in an advanced position and he scored goals so that’s kind of Joe’s position. “So he’s been a victim of a few things really but look, we like Joe and Joe trains hard. He’s a great character in terms of everything. So it takes time, you know, and as I said, we’re in the thick of it now in terms of games so I’m sure Joe will contribute.”
