Two persons have been confirmed dead after a Premium Motor Spirit (PMS)-laden truck ran into tricycles around Ikotun area of Lagos after expericing brake failure on Tuesday. The tanker accident is coming less than 48 hours after a container-laden truck crushed nine persons to death at Ojuelegba Bus-Stop in Lagos, on Sunday. In a statement made available to LEADERSHIP by the director, Public Affairs and Enlightenment Department, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Taofiq Adebayo, he disclosed that four other persons were rescued at the accident scene. LEADERSHIP reports that the accident, which occurred around 12:30pm on Tuesday, involved a fully loaded tanker with registration number JJJ 125 and four tricycles with registration numbers LSD 83 QM, AKD 690 QK and AKL 87 QF respectively. Adebayo, however, stated that a driver of one of the tricycles and a passenger died instantly in the accident. According to him, of the four rescued victims by LASTMA personnel, were two pregnant women and two children. He said, “LASTMA personnel immediately handed over those rescued victims to Police men from Ikotun Police Station who took them to General Hospital for treatment. “A preliminary investigation revealed that the fully loaded container truck (JJJ 125) had a brake failure and crushed 3 tricycles by a valley around synagogue when going towards Ikotun. “The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) immediately moved the tanker with those crushed tricycles to Ikotun Police Station. “Other emergency responders including the Nigerian Police men from Ikotun Police Station were at the scene of the accident.” Adebayo added that the general manager of LASTMA, Bolaji Oreagba, has, therefore, warned tanker owners and drivers to always ensure that their trucks are properly checked and in good condition before embarking on any journey.
