Nwanyanwu said in preparation for the 2023 general elections, the party has  reviewed its activities and also mapped out strategies towards the general elections coming up next month. He said, “We are ready for the 2023 general election. By tomorrow, Saturday, 21st of January, we will be unveiling to the whole world our updated manifesto. “All the others are virtually saying the same thing. Not that we have not been speaking to them, but we are going to have them documented as a pact, as a covenant with the people of Nigeria. It is not late, this is the best time. “And if you recall in the past, this is the time you go for campaigns. Forget about those with deep pockets they have been on jamboree of rallies and all that. No worries, we will see where it will all lead to.”
