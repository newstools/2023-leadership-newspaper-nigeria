 Nigerian musicians take the lead as they compete for an African music genre, Afrobeats, at the iHeartRadio Music Awards 2023. Wizkid, Burna Boy, Ckay, Fireboy DML, and Tems have been nominated for the Afrobeats Artist of the Year at the forthcoming 11th edition of the award. These nominated Nigerian singers made significant contributions to the global expansion and acceptance of Afrobeats. Tems, perhaps the hottest female singer on the continent of Africa, received four other nominations; ‘Best New R&B Artist,’ ‘R&B Song of the Year,’ ‘Hip-Hop Song of the Year,’ and ‘Best Collaboration.’ The 27-year-old’s ‘Wait For You’ collaboration with Future and Drake brought her total nominations to five. Mavin Records Rema was also nominated for ‘Best Music Video (Socially Voted Category)’ for his popular visuals with Selena Gomez, ‘Calm Down.’
