Atlas Lions of Morocco Qatar 2022 World Cup star, Azzedine Ounahi, is set to join Super Eagles duo Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi at Leicester as Premier League side are leading the race for his signature. Ounahi, who features for Ligue 1 club Angers has been linked to Leicester for several weeks, starred as Morocco reached the semi-finals in Qatar two weeks ago. The Foxes are believed to have offered around £20million for Ounahi. If Leicester could sign the 22-year-old in the window it would cast doubt on the future of Youri Tielemans, who was on the bench at Liverpool on Friday. Sportsmail previously reported that Tielemans was on the radar of Newcastle United, which would leave the door open for Ounahi to be a replacement. Ounahi emerged as one of the breakthrough stars of the World Cup in Qatar, forming part of the side that made history by becoming the first African team to make the semi-finals of the prestigious tournament Arsenal legend Ray Parlour implored his former side to make a move for the Moroccan, but it seems more likely to see Ounahi in the blue of the Foxes than in the red of the Gunners. Ounahi joined Angers in 2021, after a spell at another French side Avranches. He also spent some time with Strasbourg B. He made his senior debut for Morocco at the start of 2022, during the African Cup of Nations. Across the calendar year, he made 17 appearances for the country, netting a brace against the Democratic Republic of Congo. After a turbulent start to the season, Rodgers’ Foxes have now picked up 17 points across the same number of Premier League games in the 2022-23 campaign. They rounded off the year with a 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on December 30, and next step into domestic action when they host Fulham at the King Power on Tuesday night.
