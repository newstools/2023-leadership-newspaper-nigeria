 FIFA, the global governing body of football, has released the list for The Best Football Awards, with Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar among favourites in the Men’s section. However, Portugal forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, is missing from the list after a rather unimpressive campaign in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The 37-year-old scored just one goal in the tournament, from the spot, and ended the tournament with an elimination by Morocco in the quarterfinals. Argentina, which won its third FIFA World Cup after 36 years in Qatar 2022, has two players, Messi and Julian Alvarez, among nominees in the 14-member list. Alvarez, playing his first World Cup, scored four goals in the tournament, while Messi, the captain, led the scoring charts (for his country) with seven goals. Both head coaches of the teams that made it to the 2022 FIFA World Cup finals, Lionel Scaloni (Argentina) and Didier Deschamps (France) are among the five coaches nominated for the Best Men’s Football Coach, with Pep Guardiola, Carlos Ancelotti and Walid Regragui completing the list. Regragui steered Morocco to its first-ever semifinal in the World Cup.
Mbappe, Richarlison headline nominees for Puskas Award. The nominees for the Best Goal of the Year, the Puskas Award, has some of the most iconic goals from the 2022 World Cup, with Richarlison’s overhead kick against Serbia and Kylian Mbappe’s late equaliser in the 2022 World Cup final among the 12-goal list.
