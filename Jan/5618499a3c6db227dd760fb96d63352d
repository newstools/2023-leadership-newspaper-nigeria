The Bureau of the FIFA Council has suspended the Football Federation of Sri Lanka (FFSL) with immediate effect, citing government interference. The Bureau declared that the circumstances in which elections for a new FFSL Executive Committee took place on 14 January 2023 constituted undue interference by a third party in accordance with the FIFA Statutes. The world body said the lifting of the suspension will be subject to the official and written exemption from the current national sports law to be legally granted to the FFSL/Sri Lankan football in order to guarantee the recognition and implementation of the newly adopted FFSL Statutes (22 September 2022). The Bureau also demanded that FFSL administration be fully in charge of the FFSLâ€™s daily affairs until a new FFSL Executive Committee is elected, insisting that the elections of 14 January 2023 are not recognised by either FIFA or the AFC. Elections for a new FFSL Executive Committee to be organised as per the newly adopted FFSL Statutes (22 September 2022), especially by secret ballot and for a four-year mandate.
