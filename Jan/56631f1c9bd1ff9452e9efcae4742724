Presidential candidate of African Action Congress (AAC) Omoyele Sowore has said he won’t be able to take the endorsements of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and former head of state Gen Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida. The AAC presidential candidate, who stated this in a video on his Twitter handle, added that he would rather get the endorsements of millions of Nigerians who have no billions of cash. In a clear reference to Obasanjo’s recent endorsement of Labour Party candidate Peter Obi, Sowore said he would not be endorsed by those whom he described as enemies of Nigeria. He said, “Total liberation is the only solution for Nigeria. Of course I want to win as president of Nigeria but it is not about my ambition but about the people of Nigeria hovering in their pain and anguish in their millions languishing in insecurity, hunger and starvation. “I won’t be able to take the endorsement of Obasanjo and Gen Ibrahim Babangida,” adding that it would be unfair to the people of Odi and Zaki Ibiam as well as the slain journalists like Dele Giwa. “I will rather be endorsed by the very masses who have not billions of naira in their accounts but are in their millions. I would rather be endorsed by the oppressed who beat the brunt of this vulcaniser economy, which has been imposed on our people and has brought untold hardship.” He said he would rather be endorsed by those who fought against SAP and those who participated in the EndSARs protest. Sowore added that he would rather be endorsed by the northern talakawa who have been attacked by Boko Haram, Bandits and Iswap. He said, “some are desperate to be endorsed by the enemies of our people.” Also in his Twitter handle he said “Obasanjo’s repeated endorsement of @peterobi shows once again that the overrated three-time Nigerian ruler fetishises the ruination of Nigeria.” “For us, we crave and are satisfied with the endorsements of the people!#WeCantContinueLikeThis #HappyNewYear #RevolutionNow,” he said.
