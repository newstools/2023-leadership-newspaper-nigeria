Anthony Joshua is set to fight three opponents in 2023 with promoter Eddie Hearn suggesting he will first face an unnamed top 15 opponent, and Joseph Parker has put his name forward Joshua is yet to return since being ousted for a second time by Ukrainian rival Oleksandr Usyk who appeared to end the Briton’s hopes of fighting for a world title in the near future. ‘AJ’ will now need a rebuild this year to seek redemption and become a three-time world champion, with the likes of Dillian Whyte and Deontay Wilder linked as opponents. “I would love to fight Dillian Whyte again. If I can get a good win over Jack, that could be next,” Parker told Sky Sports when assessing his next options. “He’s got to fight someone. I know he’s [Joshua] looking for a trainer or working with a few trainers in America but if AJ wants a fight, let me finish Jack [Massey] off. “David Higgins, my manager sent a message to Matchroom [to ask] if Joshua needed a fight but we got no reply back,” Parker revealed. “If you’re looking for a fight, come to me. Dillian Whyte. Even Joe Joyce, if you want another fight and no one wants to fight you, let’s go again. I don’t really care. I have no worries about fighting anyone.” Parker was outpointed by Joshua in 2018, with the Briton snatching Parker’s world title to further unify the division and appear to continue his march to becoming undisputed king. However, things have since collapsed for Joshua, who has now lost three times including against Andy Ruiz Jr and Usyk twice. Joshua is currently searching for a new trainer on US soil and is yet to confirm his comeback fight, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Hearn has suggested that Joshua will look to build up to a mega-fight at the end of the year which could be either Tyson Fury or Wilder.
