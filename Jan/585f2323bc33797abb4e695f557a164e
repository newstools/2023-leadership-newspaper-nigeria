There are indications that the Nigerian Railway Corporation(NRC) in partnership with China Civil Engineering Corporation(CCECC) will soon commence movement of freight through the Standard gauge railway line fromÂ  Apapa port to the Lagos-Ibadan railway corridor. Indications to this effect became rife last week as top officials of the corporation held several meetings with stakeholders on how to fine tune the container evacuation process from A.P.Moller terminal which has already been linked to the standard gauge railway line. The Lagos district manager of the corporation, Engr. Augustine Arase said, the first meeting was held on Tuesday between officials of NRC, Government Inspectorate, Importers/Exporters and truck owners with a follow up meeting on Wednesday with A.P Miller. According to him, the deliberations were very fruitful and all is almost set for the commencement of the evacuation of goods from the A.P Miller terminal to designated freight stations along the Lagos to Ibadan railway corridor through the standard gauge railway line. Arase stated further that, hitherto, officials of NRC, CCECC, government Inspectorate, truck owners, A.P Miller amongst others inspected freight stations at Kajola, Abeokuta and Moniya to ascertain condition of the roads leading to the freight stations with a view to appeal to the state governors to put the roads linking freight stations in their respective states in motorable condition. He explained further that goods designated for Agbara Estate in Ogun state will be dropped by rail at Kajola while containers destined for Northern and Eastern parts of the country will be dropped at Ibadan and Abeokuta respectively.
