Manchester United defensive midfielder Casemiro will miss out on Sunday’s showdown with Arsenal because of suspension for yellow card accumulation. Casemiro drew his fifth yellow card of the campaign after taking down Wilfried Zaha in the second half of Wednesday’s match against Crystal Palace with Manchester United ahead 1-0. Crystal Palace equalised shortly after the costly booking and the match finished level. An irreplaceable ball-winner in the Red Devils’ midfield, Casemiro’s absence will be difficult to overcome in an already challenging fixture at the Emirates Stadium. Scott McTominay may be in line to come into the starting line-up in place of the Brazilian. The 30-year-old will serve his suspension for the Arsenal match and then will be eligible to play against Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup next Wednesday. United manager Erik ten Hag was however quick to remind Arsenal that his side were able to beat them without Casemiro at Old Trafford in the first leg fixture. United, the only side to have beaten Arsenal in the Premier League this season,  head to the Emirates in third, eight points behind Mike Arteta side and Ten Hag has told his players it is up to them to make up for Casemiro’s absence. “Last time we beat Arsenal without Casemiro,” said Ten Hag. “Casemiro is obviously a really important player for us and he is one of the reasons that we are in the position that we are now. “We have a squad and we have to fill that gap and make a proper plan and the squad has to fill it. As a team, we already showed how to beat Arsenal.” Reacting to Casemiro’s challenge on Zaha, Ten Hag told Sky Sports: “I think it’s instinctive, he went for the ball. “He missed the ball but it’s quite clear, on our right side, it could have been a dangerous situation. He wants to stop it. That was his reaction, it was quite clear. “Last time we beat Arsenal without Casemiro, so this time we have to do the same.”
