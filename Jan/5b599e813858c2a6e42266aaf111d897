The Emir of Bauchi, Dr. Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, Thursday, appointed Alhaji Muhammad Uba Ahmed Kari as the new Waziri of Bauchi Emirate. The appointment of the new Waziri, a Senior Councilor in the Bauchi Emirate Council, followed the removal of Alhaji Muhammad Bello Kirfi from the same position two days ago, for alleged disrespect and disloyalty to Governor Bala Mohammed and Bauchi State government. LEADERSHIP reports that Kirfi was a Minister of Special Duties and a political ally of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. A press statement signed by the Information Officer of the Bauchi Emirate Council, Babangida Hassan Jahun, said the turbaning ceremony of the new Waziri would be performed Friday by the Emir of Bauchi. The statement said, “The Bauchi Emirate Council fondly request the company of relatives, friends and well-wishers to the turbaning ceremony of the new Waziri of Bauchi, Alhaji Muhammad Uba Kari on 6th January, 2023 at 11:00am at the Emir’s Palace, Bauchi.” It could be recalled that the immediate-past Wazirin Bauchi, Alh. Muhammad Bello Kirfi, was on Tuesday removed by the Emirate Council following what it was termed as “Disloyalty and disrespect to the Executive Governor of the State and the government. It therefore directed for your removal with immediate effect.”
