The Supreme Court, on Friday, declared a former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Mr. Godswill Akpabio, as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Akwa Ibom North-West Senatorial District election billed for February 25, 2023. The apex court, in a unanimous decision by a five-member panel, upheld Akpabio’s arguments challenging the Court of Appeal’s judgement, which earlier nullified his candidacy. In the lead judgement that was read by Justice Ibrahim Saulawa, the apex court held that the Court of Appeal lacked the jurisdiction to meddle in the issue of nomination of candidate for an election, which it said is within the purview of an internal affair of a political party. The Supreme Court panel resolved 10 issues Akpabio raised before it in his favour and accordingly vacated the November 14, 2022 judgement of the Court of Appeal in Abuja, which earlier directed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise Mr. Udom Ekpoudom as the authentic candidate of the APC for the Akwa Ibom North-West senatorial contest.
