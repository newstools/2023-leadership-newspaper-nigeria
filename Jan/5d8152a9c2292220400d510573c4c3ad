Nigerian singer Olawale Ashimi, popularly known as Brymo, has tendered an apology to citizens from the South-east region over his anti-Igbo remarks.  The music star stirred controversy when he went on a Twitter tirade against Igbos over political affiliations and differences.  Following this, a petition was launched on Change.org for his AFRIMMA nomination to be revoked with immediate effect.  Brymo, who felt the heat and backlash from Nigerians decided to apologise during an Instagram live session.  The ‘Ara’ Crooner explained that the fracas started after he argued over the decision of award-winning author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie accepting a traditional Igbo chieftaincy title but ignoring a national honor, suggesting that it shouldn’t have been the case considering how the region is clamouring for the Presidency.  Brymo said the statement was taken out of contect because he only used it to refer to those who were championing the movement for his downfall and not the entire tribe itself.  He said:  “I didn’t insult the tribe (Igbos), I will not do that. I apologize to any one who is saddened by such tweet. I was trying to weigh in on very important matters.”
