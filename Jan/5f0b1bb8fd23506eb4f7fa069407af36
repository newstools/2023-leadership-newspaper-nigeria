Jake Paul intends to fight in MMA in 2023 after signing a deal with the Professional Fighters League (PFL). The YouTuber is unbeaten as a pro boxer from six fights but now wants to “disrupt” MMA. Paul, who will compete in the PFL’s new ‘Super Fight’ series, mentioned Nate Diaz as a potential opponent for his debut. “I know this is a tough sport, but if I can do it in boxing I can do it in MMA,” 25-year-old Paul said. Paul will also hold an advisory role as the PFL’s ‘head of fighter advocacy’. The American has been a vocal critic of the UFC and its president Dana White, in particular how much the organisation pays its fighters. The PFL has branded itself as a “fighter-first” organisation since launching in 2017 and its new ‘Super Fight’ division will see fighters take home 50% of the pay-per-view revenue. “A true 50/50 partnership with fighters that still allows them to be individuals,” Paul said. Two ‘Super Fight’ shows are planned for 2023, with two-time PFL lightweight champion Kayla Harrison expected to headline one of those events. A date for Paul’s first fight has yet to be announced but he also could feature in one of the ‘Super Fight’ shows. Suggesting a bout with UFC legend and free agent Diaz could be a possibility, he said: “I’m so dedicated to this that I offered Nate Diaz a two-fight deal” Paul said “First we box. Then six months later we fight MMA in the PFL. Nate Diaz, I am down to fight you in your own sport.
