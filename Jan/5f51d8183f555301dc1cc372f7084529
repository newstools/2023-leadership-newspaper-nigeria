The Borno South senatorial candidate under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hon Satumari Kudla said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), in the state has run out of options, stating that it is laughable to say their party is dead in the state.
Speaking to journalists in Abuja, Kudla said with the improvement in the electoral process, room for electoral manipulation has been blocked adding that his party will take over Borno State by next month.
Kudla who was responding to statements by the APC in Borno State that the PDP is dead, insisted that the ruling party has lost out of options on how to campaign.
“It is laughable to say PDP is dead in Borno State,” Kudla said adding that, “You can see and you can hear about the paradigm that is shifting.
He said: “If you go to Borno State today, you will hear water vendors, Newspaper sellers talking about the need for a change.
“Nothing will make them vote for APC again. They are saying it with conviction and from the bottom of their hearts. If the turnout at campaign rallies is anything to go by, it also speaks volume. “Just like someone will say if you dance somewhere, they spread money. If another person dances in the same place, they stone him. That’s exactly what is happening in Borno State. “If you go to PDP rallies, a lot of people turn out peacefully. You can see the passion and the enthusiasm in them and how they intend to vote for the PDP. “We have seen scanty gatherings of the APC whenever they go out for rallies, even in Gwoza. You watch on social media how they are booed. Anywhere you see PDP gathering, you see the crowd gathering organically.”
