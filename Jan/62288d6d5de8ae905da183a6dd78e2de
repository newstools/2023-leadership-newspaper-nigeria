The management of Kaduna Electric said her attention has been drawn to unfortunate attempts to politicize ongoing power supply challenges especially in Kaduna. A statement issued by Abdulazeez Abdullahi, Head, Corporate Communication reiterated that current reduced supply hours to our customers in some parts of our Franchise Area is strictly as a result of reduced allocation from the national grid due to lower power generation and Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) programme for improved grid management. He said, the situation is not peculiar to Kaduna Electric as it is nationwide and stakeholders and sector managers are working to return the situation to normal and improve operations. Accordingly, he said, “ascribing the situation to any other reasons (political or otherwise) than above stated reasons is baseless and untrue and we ask our valuable customers to ignore such reports. “We call on our esteemed customers to ignore such messages in circulation on social media which are capable of causing disaffection amongst residents and stakeholders. “We are working closely with TCN to ensure power supply improves to our customers in Kaduna, Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi States. “We will continue to provide updates as the situation improves and stakeholders may find additional information on our website and social media handles at www.kadunaelectric.com and @kadunaelectric respectively,” he stated.
