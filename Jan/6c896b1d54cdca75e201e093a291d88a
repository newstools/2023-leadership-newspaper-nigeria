Roma FC coach, Jose Mourinho, has likened Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen to his former Chelsea striker, Didier Drogba. Osimhen proved Napoli’s matchwinner against Roma on Sunday. “He is of the same level as Drogba, but Didier didn’t dive,” said Mourinho. “If Victor changes, then OK. I’d buy him if I was at a club with a lot of money. However, if he does go to England one day, he needs to change, because in Italy they put up with this sort of behaviour, whereas in the Premier League, they’d come down hard on him,” he added. Mourinho spoke to Osimhen at the final whistle. “I told him that he scored a wonderful goal and needs to stop diving so much. His goal was fantastic, he did the same thing when we met earlier this season, so he’s a fantastic player. But he mustn’t dive,” he added.
