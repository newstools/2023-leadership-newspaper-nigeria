The Plateau State Police Command, in its aggressive fight against crime and criminality, has again foiled the attempted kidnapping of the Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Sanda. According to a statement issued in Jos by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Alfred Alabo, he said three unidentifield gunmen operating in an grey-coloured CR-V Jeep arrived the Speaker’s residence at the Federal Low-cost Housing in Jos South LGA of the State on Thursday. He explained that after trailing the Speaker to his residence, the hoodlums attempted to enter his house to kidnap him but their mission was made impossible by the intrepid Police officers on guard duty, and the timely response of the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), SP Ayuba, and his men, who joined forces with the men on guard duty to repel the assailants. Alabo further added that the Command was making concerted effort to track down the fleeing suspects and get them arrested. The PPRO thanked members of the public for showing concern about the happenings in their various communities and volunteering to give timely information to the Police for prompt action. He urged residents of the State to go about their lawful businesses as the Police was already doing a lot to ensure the safety of all and will continue to frustrate the evil and dastardly act of men of the underworld through the effective and proactive crime prevention strategies put in place by the chief crime buster of the State, CP Bartolomew N. Onyeka.
