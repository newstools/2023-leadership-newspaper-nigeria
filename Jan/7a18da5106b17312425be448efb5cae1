Elvis’ Actor, Travis Butler acknowledged veteran actor Denzel Washington when he received the Best Actor in Drama category at the Golden Globe Awards recently. Butler during his acceptance speech at the awards said, “I gotta thank Denzel Washington. Denzel, thank you for your kindness, thank you for your generosity and championing me when you did not have to.” The 31-year-old actor who had worked with Washington in the Broadway production of The Iceman Cometh described him as “the godfather of father”, noting that sharing the stage with the actor changed his of himself and his abilities as actor. “Something Denzel told me is: There is no stage acting or film acting; there is the truth,” the actor shares the lessons from Washington he frequently returns to. Human beings do really broad things in everyday life. sometimes, they do very subtle things. you can do either onstage or onscreen. That freed me up to realize (that) I could take them back into film.”
