 The Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission(NUPRC) has shortlisted 139 companies for the next stage of the country’s gas flaring commercialisation programme. The exercise is part of federal governments plan to reduce carbon emissions. In September last year,  minister of state for petroleum resources, Timipre Sylva said, plans were at an advanced stage to commercialise gas burned from its oil fields to help cut 15 million tonnes of carbon emissions from the atmosphere. The Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission chief executive, Gbenga Komolafe said, in a statement seen on Tuesday, out of the 300 companies that applied, 139 had been shortlisted to proceed to the next stage of the programme. He did not say when the next phase would commence. Nigeria has been trying to harness gas belching from its oil fields so it can be exported or used to generate power but has been hobbled by lack of finance.
