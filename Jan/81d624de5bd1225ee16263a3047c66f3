The chairman of Abia State All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Rally Campaign,  Major-General Charles Okoro, has said the party is set for a mega rally for its presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu. Addressing newsmen yesterday at the party’s campaign office in Umuahia, the state capital, Okoro added that every necessary arrangements have been put in place to ensure the success of the January 24 event. “Our only concern is the size of the venue which is Umuahia Township Stadium. Definitely the crowd will be massive. But, with my military background and experience we will be up to the task,” he noted. Similarly, the chairman of the opposition party, Dr. Kingsley Ononogbu stressed that voting for the party remains the best option for the state to address the rot and underdevelopment it has found itself in. He argued that for almost 24 years, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) government has done nothing positive rather than impoverishing the people and leaving unpaid salaries, gratuities, and pension. According to him, the ruling party has also failed on infrastructure development, social service delivery, human capital development, and creation of employment opportunities for the youths.  He said under the about eight years APC federal government, the South East had witnessed records of achievements the PDP could not make after 16 years on the saddle.  “I am optimistic that Tinubu will win the election. And this is the most reason the state should also have an APC government. We can’t afford to be in opposition for obvious reasons,” he added.  The director general of the party’s Campaign Council, High Chief Uche Ogboso, speaking, lamented the deplorable condition of the state, saying it was the most reason the people are clamouring for change.  “But, the change must be led by a candidate who knows how to achieve it. And this is why our governorship candidate, High Chief Ikechi Emenike stands taller than the others,” he maintained.
