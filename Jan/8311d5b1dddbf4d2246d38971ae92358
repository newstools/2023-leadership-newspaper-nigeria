Barely 72 hours after the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, campaigned in Ekiti State, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Friday, disolved the state executive committee of the party and set up a caretaker committee in its place. National publicity secretary of PDP, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, who disclosed this in a statement, said the Ekiti State Caretaker Committee will run the party’s affairs in the State for a period of three months. The party picked Arch. Sadiq Obanoyen as chairman of the Ekiti State Caretaker Committee. LEADERSHIP reports that former governor Ayo Fayose and Senator Olubunmi Olujimi have been at loggerheads over the control of PDP structure in the State. However, Fayose, who has aligned with the G-5 governors within the PDP, was absent at the party’s presidential rally in the State, while Senator Olujimi, a former Senate minority leader, was present at the campaign rally. The statement signed by Ologunagba stated, “Following the recent developments in the Ekiti State Chapter of our great Party, the National Working Committee (NWC), after careful deliberations and extensive consultations, on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and pursuant to Sections 29(2)(b) and 31(2)(e) of the Constitution of the PDP (as amended in 2017), has dissolved the PDP Ekiti State Executive Committee with immediate effect. “In its place the NWC, on behalf of NEC has approved the appointment of Ekiti State Caretaker Committee to run the affairs of the Party in the State for a period of three (3) months effective from today Friday, January 20, 2023 and to function pursuant to Section 24(2) of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017). “The NWC also approved the appointment of Arch.
