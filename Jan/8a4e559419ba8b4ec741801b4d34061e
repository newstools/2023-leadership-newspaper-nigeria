Super Eagles forward Terem Moffi has officially left French Ligue 1 side Lorient and joined West Ham United for €24 million. Hammers boss, David Moyes, has been chasing the Nigerian international for a couple of weeks now, but there was a discrepancy on the fee between he Ligue 1 and Premier League clubs. It now seems as though a deal has been struck between Lorient and West Ham, with Moffi closing in on a move to England from France. According to a French publication, Lorient have accepted West Ham United’s offer to offload the gangling striker to the English Premier League side West Hammers FC Moffi was reportedly undecided over a move to the London club, but it seems he is now set to link up with David Moyes’ side. Another Ligue I club, OGC Nice were also interested in the Super Eagles forward but Les Aiglons failed to meet Lorient’s valuation. Southampton also had a bid rejected for Moffi earlier in the window. The 23-year-old has scored 12 goals in 18 league outings for Lorient this season, coming second just behind Paris Saint Germain’s Kylliam Mbappe.
