The New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) has said Babayo Liman is neither still a member of the party nor its secretary in the North East. According to the party, it viewed with serious concern, the activities of Alhaji Liman, the former North East zonal secretary, in the past few months which contrasted what the party stands for, adding that they can no longer fold their arms. A statement issued by the national publicity secretary of the NNPP, Agbo Major Gilbert, said Alhaji Liman, through gross misconduct and indiscipline, can no longer continue to be a member of the party. “Consequently, the national leadership of the party wishes to inform the general public that Alhaji Babayo Liman is no longer a member of the Party and its North East zonal secretary. “We in the NNPP are concerned with bringing about a new Nigeria, and such behaviours exhibited by Alh. Babayo Liman do not represent our highly cherished values. “We hereby warn Babayo Liman to stop parading himself under whatever guise as a member of the NNPP. By this, the party also wishes to draw the attention of all Nigerians to stop dealing with Babayo on behalf of the party,” the statement added.
