Bendel Insurance maintained their unbeaten runs in the Nigeria Premier Football League after edging out Kwara United 1-0 at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan on Sunday. Imade Osehenkhoe scored the only goal of the match in the 25th minute to hand Benin Arsenal all three points at stake. It was Osehenkhoe’s second goal in four league outings this season.Meanwhile, Abia Warriors could not sustain their fine start to the new season, losing 0-1 at home to Lobi Stars with Kumaga Suur scoring the decisive goal on 56 minutes.In a cagey encounter which pitched the Warriors with two wins against the Makurdi side with a loss and win, there was nothing to choose in the first half as it ended goalless. Though, it should have been a different score line after Umar Abba in a one-on-one situation couldn’t beat goalkeeper Femi Thomas who saved his effort in the 38th minute. However, in the second phase of the game, Joseph Atule passed the ball nicely to Suur to score his first league goal of the season and Lobi’s winner. With the result, Lobi Stars have now won two consecutive games . They play host to newly promoted side, Bayelsa United in their next game. In Jos, Akwa United thrashed their hosts Nasarawa United 3-0. It was the Promise Keepers first win of the campaign. Ndifreke Effiong netted twice, while James Ajako scored the other goal. Another away win was recorded at the Umuahia Township Stadium. At the Awka City Stadium, Rangers were forced to a 1-1 draw by Sunshine Stars.
