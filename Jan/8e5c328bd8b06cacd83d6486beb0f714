The State Working Committee (SWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Plateau State has ratified the expulsion of factional chairman Ishaya Itse from the party. A press statement by the state publicity secretary, Sylvanus Namang, said, in a unanimous decision by the 17 members of the SWC at its meeting at the Kalwa House party secretariat in Jos last week, the party acted on the letter expelling Ishaya Itse from his Jos Jarawa Ward of Jos North dated January 12, 2023. Namang explained that Itse’s expulsion was duly approved by the Jos North local government party exco on January 16. He added that it was in line with the provisions of the constitution of the APC, the State Executive Committee (SEC) which duly ratified his expulsion on Thursday, January 19, 2023. Parts of the statement read: “Ishaya Itse who had been parading himself as a factional Chairman of the party was expelled for, among others, breaching provisions of the APC constitution, anti- party activities, impersonation of party offices or its holders, creating parallel party organ in the state, engagement in fraudulent and dishonest practices and filing an action in court without exhausting avenues for redress.” He said in ratifying the expulsion of Ishaya Itse, the APC SWC sternly warned that anybody having any dealing with him does so at his or her own risk. The ruling party also called on security agencies to keep a close watch on Itse, saying he could cause serious breach of the peace having allowed himself to be used as a cheap tool in the hands of detractors of the APC. “The SWC also directed the immediate withdrawal of all privileges hitherto enjoyed by Ishaya Itse which include membership of the APC Presidential Campaign Council and access to any APC office or functions.”  He warned those instigating Ishaya Itse to “desist forthwith from their nefarious acts or be ready to face the consequences while calling on all its supporters to remain calm in the face of any distraction as it remains ever focused on delivering their candidates from top to bottom during the general elections.”
