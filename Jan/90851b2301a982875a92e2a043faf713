The Public Complaints Commission (PCC) has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria  (CBN) to up its game in making the new naira notes available to Nigerians. The PCC federal commissioner representing Ekiti State, Hon. Kayode Bamisile, who made the call, said the outrage trailing the distribution showed that the people are finding it difficult to access the new currencies. Bamisile saidt the distribution was lopsided and not being fully implemented in Ekiti going by the barrage of complaints that had been received and verified by the commission. Addressing newsmen on Thursday , in Ado Ekiti, the state capital on the activities of the commission. The PCC boss also praised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for intensifying efforts  to ensure intending voters collect their PVCs ahead of forthcoming general elections. “The commission has been monitoring the process closely in the state, since the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele gave directive for the distribution of the redesigned N200, N500 and N1000 notes. “Our team led by the director of investigation, went to all banks in Ado Ekiti and other local government areas, where we have our offices, to ensure that bank customers have access to the new naira notes and the CBN’s directive adhered to. We also met with the state CBN branch manager.’’ “Actually, there were challenges, most of the banks visited were giving out both new and old naira notes to their customers, but the complaint is that, Automated Teller Machines (ATM) mostly dispense old notes, even the same is the situation in the banking hall. “I don’t think the directive is being implemented fully here in Ekiti State. In certain cases, some of the ATMs are not working. The commissioner, who noted that the people in the local areas and hinterlands of the state are seriously being affected, urged CBN to intensify sensitisation on the new naira notes and the withdrawal of the old notes especially at the grassroots.
