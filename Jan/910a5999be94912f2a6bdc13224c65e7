He also pledged to engage with the people of the region on the restructuring of Nigeria. Atiku made the pledges yesterday at the Pa Ngele Orunta Township Stadium, Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital during the party’s presidential campaign rally. He promised to align with the people of the zone to end the outcry noting that to move the country forward, the demands, yearnings and aspiration of the people of the different zones of the country must be listened to and a constructive dialogue engaged. He expressed concern over the level of insecurity, bad governance and economic failures witnessed under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration and asserted that the zone would witness great change under his presidency. Atiku said he has all it takes to reposition the country, revive the economy, ensure an end to the insecurity challenges in the country adding that only a competent leader can turn the country around. In his remarks, the national chairman of the PDP, Dr Iyorchia Ayo, attributed the achievements recorded in Ebonyi State to the quality leadership of the PDP administrations and called on the people to continue to support the party. He thanked the people of the state for coming out in their numbers to support the party and promised the readiness of the party to ensure that it fulfils all its presidential campaign promises after its victory at the polls.
