 A civil society organisation (CSO), African Center for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), has said that if the Department of Security Services (DSS) had succeeded in its alleged unlawful attempt to remove the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, and INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, then President Muhammadu Buhari’s effort for peaceful transition of power would have been derailed. The group in a statement by its Strategic Communication Consultant, Comrade Abubakar Isa, insisted that the DG of DSS, Yusuf Magaji Bichi, and operatives allegedly involved in the trumped-up allegation of terrorism against Emefiele must be made to face the law. According to him, it’s unthinkable that the DSS tried to undermine CBN and INEC efforts for free and fair elections, 50 days to the 2023 polls. The statement reads, “Last week the Court quashed the Department of Security Services’ move to charge CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, with trumped up charges of terrorism financing and economic crimes. Justice M.A. Hassan barred the DSS from inviting, arresting, detaining or charging the CBN Governor with any allegation of terrorism or fraudulent act. The Justice described the plot to arrest Emefiele of terrorism as oppressive, baseless, fabricated and unacceptable. “While we laud the Court ruling, this shameful behaviour by the DSS won’t be swept under the rug. Operatives involved must be brought to book.”
