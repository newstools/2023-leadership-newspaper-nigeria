A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chukwuemeka Eze, has called on the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alh Atiku Abubakar, to rescind further reconciliatory moves with Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike and the G5 governors, also known as the Integrity Group. He said it would be appropriate for Atiku and the PDP national leadership to channel attention and invest into more fruitful political ventures that would yield result at the polls in 2023. Eze, who is also a former national publicity secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party (nPDP), made the call in a statement made available to LEADERSHIP Weekend in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The APC chieftain said, after following recent happenings in the PDP as regards to Wike and his face-off with Atiku, he wishes to wade in and proffer a way out of the seemingly unsolvable crisis. “Having related with and understudied the duo of Atiku and Wike, the face-off between the two men is not based on any misunderstanding or whatever but on the political miscalculation on the side of Wike who never took time to understudy who Atiku is and his style of politicking. “One thing Wike has succeeded in doing all this while the hostility has lasted is ridiculing himself and undermining and foreclosing his relevance in the politics of Nigeria,” he said.
