 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended the chairman of Ebonyi State chapter of the party, Okorie Tochukwu Okoroafor, for anti-party activities. The PDP National Working Committee (NWC) took the decision at its emergency meeting held on Friday, January 27, 2023. It said the suspension comes after an extensive review of Okoroafor’s conduct and his activities as Ebonyi State chairman of the party. The suspension comes barely 24 hours after the PDP held its presidential campaign rally in the State. In a statement signed by the PDP national publicity secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, he said “Pursuant to Sections 29 (2) (b) and 57(3) of the Constitution of the PDP (as amended in 2017) the NWC has on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC) approved the suspension of Okorie Tochukwu Okoroafor with effect from today, Friday, January 27, 2023, over allegations of anti-party activities and violation of provisions of Section 58 (1) of the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017). “Consequently, Okorie Tochukwu Okoroafor has been referred to the Party’s appropriate Disciplinary Committee for further action.” Okoroafor’s suspension followed a recent string of suspensions of party members in recent times for anti-party activities. Just last week, the party suspended Senator Chimaroke Nnamani as well as some Ekiti State party chieftains over anti-party activities.
