The National leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has lifted the suspension slammed on two out of the seven party members in Ekiti State, namely; Prince Funso Ayeni (Ekiti North Senatorial Candidate) and Otunba Ajayi Babatunde Samuel (Ekiti North II Federal Constituency Candidate).  PDP said it lifted the suspension on the duo after they apologised for their conduct, affirmed loyalty to the party and renewed commitment towards the party’s success at all levels in the forthcoming 2023 general elections, when they appeared before a Disciplinary Committee.  Recall that the PDP had last week suspended seven candidates of the party gunning for federal legislative seats in Ekiti State over alleged anti-party activities. They included Ayeni; Samuel; Ajijola Lateef Oladimeji (Ekiti Central); Emiola Adenike Jennifer (Ekiti South II federal constituency); Olayinka James Olalere (Ekiti Central federal constituency); Akerele Oluyinka (Ekiti North I federal constituency), and Fayose Oluwajomiloju John (Ekiti Central I federal constituency).  The party also suspended a former Enugu State governor and senatorial candidate, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, alongside and Chief Chris Ogbu of Imo State chapter of the party over same offence.  However, the national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba on Saturday, said Ayeni and Samuel showed remorse when they appeared before the disciplinary committee of the party.  Ologunagba in a statement said, “The decision of the National Working Committee (NWC) is sequel to the report of the Disciplinary Committee which recommended the lifting of the suspension on Prince Funso Ayeni, Otunba Ajayi Babatunde Samuel on the ground of manifest remorse, apology for their conduct, affirmed loyalty to the Party and the PDP Constitution (as amended in 2017) as well as renewed commitment towards the success of the PDP at all levels in the 2023 general elections.  “By the lifting of the suspension, the status of Prince Funso Ayeni and Otunba Ajayi Babatunde Samuel as members of the PDP and especially as PDP Candidates for Ekiti North Senatorial District and Ekiti North II Federal Constituency respectively in the 2023 general election are fully restored.  “The NWC urges all members, supporters and teeming members of our Party in Ekiti State to remain united and continue to work together for the success of the PDP at all levels in the 2023 general elections.”
