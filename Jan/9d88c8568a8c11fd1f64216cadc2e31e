The people of Akpa-Edem, Ozzi-Edem and Okutu communities in Nsukka local government area of Enugu State have told Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi who is the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Enugu North senatorial district in the 2023 general election not to bother coming to their areas to campaign. They said that Governor Ugwuanyi’s administration has been fair to them in terms of the distribution of democratic dividends as well as political appointments in spite of the state’s lean resources and the nation’s economic challenges, saying they would have their votes at the poll. Speaking when a delegation of Akpa/Ozzi Edem ward paid Governor Ugwuanyi a solidarity visit at the Government House, Enugu, Chief Silas Ifeanyi (Baba Edem), said the people of the two communities were delighted at the ongoing construction of their connecting road, the Ozzi-Akpa Edem Road, which leads to Abuja through Ida in Kogi State. Chief Ifeanyi stressed that the people of the communities were excited because “we have never seen this kind of development before,” adding that “many old people in my community have never seen this kind of development before especially those from Amagu which is bounded by Uzo-Uwani, Okpuje and Kogi State.” Pointing out that the Akpa-Edem and Ozzi-Edem are agrarian communities, the leader of the delegation stated that when the road is completed, there would be sufficient food in Nsukka “because Amagu people will convey their farm produce to Nsukka in large quantities with ease.” He beseeched God to continue to strengthen Governor Ugwuanyi to complete the road and other ongoing projects of his administration in the state before the end of his tenure.
