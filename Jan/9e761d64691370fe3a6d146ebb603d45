The Rivers State Police Command has remained silent over the attack on the convoy of the governorship candidate of the Accord Party (A) in the State, Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, by suspected political thugs at Igbo-Etche, Etche local government area of the State, more than 24 hours after the incident.  This is as Lulu-Briggs and the chairman of Etche local government area, Hon. Obinna Anyanwu, continued to trade words over who was responsible for the attack on the convoy.  The Accord Party governorship candidate had in an interview with journalists said he tried reaching out to the Commissioner of Police but was not successful.  He said: “The whole convoy shot at, shot at people. It is terrible. I don’t understand what this has turned into. It’s a jungle state now, lawless place.  “We will not be allowed to campaign and Rivers people will decide who will be their governor, their Senators, you know. It is not by violence, attacking people.  “These things must stop. It is not a kangaroo state. We have a country. I tried to reach the Commissioner of Police, but I couldn’t get him. But I sent him a message by text. I hope that he will get my message and call me. This nonsense has to stop.”  But, speaking with journalists, chairman of Etche local government council, Hon. Obinna Anyanwu, denied the allegation that the leadership of the council was behind the attack.  Anyanwu, who spoke through his media aide, Robinson Oluor, said the chairman of the Local Government Revenue Mobilization Committee and one Frank Igwe led the thugs that attacked the Accord Party convoy.  He advised the Accord Party to address its internal crisis instead of pointing fingers at the people.
