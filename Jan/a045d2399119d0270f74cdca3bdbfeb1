 Nigeria Football Federation and the Football Association of Zambia have postponed the double-header friendly between Nigeria’s U-20 team and their Zambian counterparts. According to the Director of Media and Communications of the NFF, Ademola Olajire, the games will now be played February 3 and 6 in Abuja. “The Football Association of Zambia and their Nigerian counterparts have rescheduled their two friendly matches involving their U-20 sides to February 3 and 6 respectively,” FAZ also confirmed in a statement. LEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that the postponement is due to a travelling hitch. Zambia and Nigeria were scheduled to square off January 27 and 30 in warm-up matches ahead of the 2023 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. Seven-time champions Nigeria are drawn with hosts Egypt, Mozambique and Senegal in Group A of the tournament. The 2023 U-20 AFCON, which will be played from February 9 to March 11, will serve as qualifiers for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia.
