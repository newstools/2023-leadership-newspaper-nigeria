 Gombe local government area auditor-general of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mahmud Mohammed Wafa has dumped the party for the opposition New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) in the state. Wafa disclosed his defection yesterday to journalists after his meeting with the NNPP governorship candidate in the state, Khamis Ahmed Mailantarki in his residence. Wafa said he joined the NNPP to rescue the state from the APC government that has downgraded the state to a hopeless situation. “Looking at the present debauched situation, we need to put heads together to rescue the state from the APC led-government and the PDP has been in disarray and confusion since after its primary election in March last year. So, it can’t give us the leadership we want.” “It is obvious with his track records and humility, Mailantarki will provide better leadership in the state compared with those in APC and PDP and NNPP is the only platform that we can leverage to stabilise the state beyond 2023,” he said.
