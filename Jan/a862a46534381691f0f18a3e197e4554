Joao Felix has flown to London for his Chelsea medical ahead of a loan move from Atletico Madrid until the end of the season. The Blues, who are set to beat Premier League rivals Manchester United and Arsenal to the signing of the Portugal forward, will pay an €11m (£9.69m) loan fee plus his wages. Felix would provide a much-needed boost to head coach Graham Potter’s attacking options, with his side scoring just 20 goals in 17 Premier League matches this season. Despite the transfer window only being open for just over a week, Chelsea have already been active in January, signing Benoit Badiashile, David Datro Fofana and Andrey Santos. Potter will hope their arrivals can help to improve his team’s form, with just one win coming from their last seven matches in all competitions. Chelsea are currently 10th in the Premier League – 10 points outside the top four – and have already been knocked out of the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Felix was part of the Portugal squad at last month’s World Cup The west London club’s only realistic remaining hope of silverware this season is in the Champions League, where they face Borussia Dortmund in the last 16 next month. Felix has just seven LaLiga starts for Atletico this season but he was named in the starting XI for their 1-0 defeat at home to Barcelona on Sunday.
