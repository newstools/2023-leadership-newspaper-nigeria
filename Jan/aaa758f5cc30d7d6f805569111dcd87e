 A traditional ruler, His Majesty, Enyi Friday Abaja, of Umukwata Kingdom in Delta State has constructed a 5 Kilometers of road to ease difficulties his people were passing through while moving from one community to another. This is coming as plans have reached advanced stage to commission the road in a few weeks time. A community leader of the kingdom, Mr. Sam Enudi who made this known, said, the project is among a chain of philanthrophic gestures of the traditional ruler. He noted that the traditional ruler had given scholarships to some indigent students from his immediate community attending Delta State University and others. Apart from intervening in disputes between watering communities, he disclosed that, the traditional ruler unilaterally built a health center, installed street lights and built interlock roads in his immediate community of Umukwata. “He equally built market in Abbi and a conglomerate of shopping mall between Obiaruku, Obinomba, and Owah-Abbi ,thereby bringing salient developments to these communities,” Enudi said.
