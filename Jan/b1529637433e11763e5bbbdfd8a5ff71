 Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) Omoyele Sowore has condemned the killing of two Yoruba national agitators in Lagos State. Sowore, who reacted to the killing on his twitter handle, described the killing by Police as unprovoked. Two persons lost their lives on Monday, in the violence that broke out at Ojota, Lagos, between policemen and Yoruba nation agitators. He said the agitators were having a peaceful rally until the incident occurred. But Sowore said, “Blood thirsty Nigeria Police Force @PoliceNG reportedly kill two Yoruba Nation agitators at a peaceful rally in Ojota, Lagos today. I totally condemn this unprovoked murder of peaceful demonstrators.”
