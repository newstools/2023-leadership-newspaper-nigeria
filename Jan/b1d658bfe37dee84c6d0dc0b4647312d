The Nigerian stock market yesterday opened the week positive as the capitalisation advanced by N257 billion. The All Share Index (ASI) rose by 470.74 points, representing an increase of 0.92 per cent to close at 51,693.08 points. While the overall market capitalisation value gained N257 billion to close at N28.156 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Airtel Africa, Nigerian Breweries, United Capital, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGXGroup) and Africa Prudential. Looking into the week, United Capital Plc  expected the bears to resume activities across counters, as we anticipate further spread across other sectors as investors book profits from the extended rally. According to United Capital, the central Bank of Nigeria’s recent Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) debits in the money market will likely discourage investors from sustaining investment in equities in the short-term as they hope for improvement in money market yields. “However, we see any downturn as a short-term buying opportunity as we expect investors’ risk-on sentiments will linger through Q1,2023, favouring the equities market, as the prevailing downward pressure interest rates will persist through the quarter.” Market sentiment, as measured by market breadth was positive as 18 stocks gained, relative to 16 losers.
