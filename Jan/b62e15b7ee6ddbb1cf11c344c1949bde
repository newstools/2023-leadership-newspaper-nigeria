 All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Southwest zone has decried the low rate of collection of permanent voter cards (PVCs) ahead of the forthcoming general elections. As a way forward, the campaign announced the immediate launch of “Operation Collect Your PVC” across all the states in the Southwest. At the Southwest meeting of the PCC held in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Thursday, the meeting also charged the party members in the zone on the need for the southwest to return massive votes for the Presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in order to ensure victory for the APC. The meeting was attended by the coordinator of the APC PCC, Southwest zone, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and other members of the PCC in the six States of the Southwest zone. In the communiqué issued and signed by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and Hon. Isaac Kekemeke, deputy coordinator, the meeting also approved the request of the Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to appoint Dr. John Fayemi, to assist and support him in coordinating the Southwest campaign activities. The communiqué read, “The meeting deliberated on issues that will further boost the chances of the APC in the Southwest and resolved as follows: “Council praises its chairman, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) for his leadership and candour. It notes with satisfaction his improved state of health and prayed for his speedy recovery and continued service to Ondo state and Nigeria as a nation.”  “In furtherance to the foregoing, Council enjoins Governors of all APC controlled states to declare Tuesday, 24th January, 2023  as work-free day to aid collection of PVC.’’
