Federal High Court in Awka, the Anambra State capital yesterday sacked Chief Victor Umeh,  as the candidate of Labour party for Anambra central senatorial zone. The court,  in its ruling on Friday, agreed that Umeh violated the electoral act for standing for election in same constituency for two different political parties. Umeh who contested and lost in APGA, defected to Labour party where he was nominated as the party’s senatorial candidate. The court therefore nullified Labour party’s primary election that produced Umeh. With this judgement, Labour party has no candidate in Anambra central senatorial zone.
