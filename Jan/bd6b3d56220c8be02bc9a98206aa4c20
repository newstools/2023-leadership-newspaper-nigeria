Cristiano Ronaldo has suffered a major blow in his FIFA 23 rating following his move to Saudi Arabian side, Al Nassr. Ronaldo’s rating took a nosedive in his updated FIFA 23 rating, as the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is now 88. The Portugal international has long been one of the most highly-rated players in the FIFA game. Ronaldo entered the FIFA game in 2003 and in 2004 he was rated 80. In 2006 the Portuguese broke into the 90s for the first time, receiving a rating of 91. He became the best-rated player in FIFA 17 with a rating of 94 and retained the position in FIFA 18 before levelling with Lionel Messi in FIFA 19. Since FIFA 19, the former Real Madrid and Juventus superstar’s rating has been sliding as he loses one point each year, he started FIFA 23 with a rating of 90. Ronaldo’s unceremonious exit from Manchester United, his unconvincing 2022 FIFA World Cup performances and now his move to Al-Nassr have taken a toll on his overall rating. His man’s FIFA 23 rating has now slipped to 88, dropping below 90 for the first time since FIFA 11. It’s his worst FIFA rating since 2007, in which he received a rating of 87. The former Manchester United star’s dribbling ability has dropped to 81 from 84. Also, Ronaldo’s stamina rating is now standing at 70 from an initial 74.
