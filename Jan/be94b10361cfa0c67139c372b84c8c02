Senator Abdul Ahmed Ningi, a political ally of the PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar has said that the former vice-president is in total support of the re-election of Bauchi State governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed ahead of the March gubernatorial election in the state. Ningi, a former deputy majority leader of the Senate said this in an interview with journalists in Bauchi. He said it was unbelievable to think that either Bala Mohammed or Atiku will work to truncate the progress and success of each other being members of the same political party and from the same subregion, northeast. Ningi said there is no basis for disharmony to hold sway between the two, adding that all Bauchi PDP members are working hard to ensure that Atiku is elected president and Bala returns as governor in February and March, respectively. He described insinuations suggesting the existence of discord between Atiku and the governor as belated lies. “Both Atiku and Kaura belong to the same party. They are all members of PDP united and working to support each other. “All well-meaning PDP members look up to each other as brothers brought together by the unputdownable bounds of a shared common goal. “At the moment in Bauchi, Atiku and Bala share the same campaign materials and enjoy the same campaign without preference and prejudice,” he said. Ningi said in PDP unlike in other political parties in Nigeria, nobody will say vote for this person in PDP and that in another party. “This is the tradition,” he insisted.
