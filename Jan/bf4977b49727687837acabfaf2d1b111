A spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Phrank Shaibu, has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was using current petrol scarcity and the Naira redesign policy as excuses for his imminent defeat in the forthcoming February 25 poll. Recall that while speaking at his campaign rally in Abeokuta, Ogun State earlier on Wednesday, Tinubu said the scarcity of petrol and change of the naira’s design were targeted at him and to scuttle the 2023 general elections. “This election is a revolution. They said fuel will be expensive — will be N200, N500. Put your mind at rest, we will bring it down. “They don’t want the election to hold. They want to disrupt it. Will you allow that? Will you vote?” the former Lagos governor had said. But, reacting to Tinubu’s alarm in a statement on Wednesday, Shaibu said Tinubu was running from “pillar to post” despite claiming that he installed President Muhammadu Buhari in office. He added that Tinubu’s outburst on fuel scarcity in Abeokuta was an attack on President Muhammadu Buhari, who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum Resources. “Frustrated by President Muhammadu Buhari’s unwillingness to attend some of his insipid rallies, Tinubu launched an attack against the president who doubles as the Minister of Petroleum. “It is funny that Tinubu is just commenting over the fuel scarcity which started in different parts of the country as far back as February 2022. In Lagos, where Tinubu claims to be the landlord, the state has been witnessing fuel queues since last November. “It is therefore dubious of Tinubu to try to extricate himself from the failures of his party because elections are 30 days away. “Having seen his imminent defeat at the polls, he is already using the fuel scarcity and naira redesign as excuses. Tinubu should throw in the towel or get ready to be disgraced on February 25, 2023. “A word is enough for the wise,” Shaibu stated.
