The Athletics Federation of Nigeria, AFN, says its annual general congress earlier fixed to hold later this month in Bauchi will now hold in Jalingo, the capital of Taraba State. In a letter dated Thursday, January 5, 2023, and addressed to State Athletics Associations, Rita Mosindi, Secretary General of the federation says the congress will now hold a week later than the earlier rescheduled date of Saturday, January 21, 2023. ‘I am directed to inform you that the postponed Athletics Federation of Nigeria Annual General Congress earlier scheduled to hold on Saturday, January 21st, 2023 in Bauchi has been rescheduled to hold in Jalingo, Taraba State,’ read the letter inter-alia. The AFN also revealed accommodation and transport subsidies will be provided for congress members viz chairmen of the 36 state athletics association and Abuja or their secretary. The congress was earlier billed to hold in Asaba, Delta state on the sidelines of the 21st National Sports Festival last December but was first shifted to Bauchi and now Jalingo. The Congress is expected to deliberate and approve the federation’s programme of activities for the 2023 athletics season. The congress is expected to be chaired by Tonobok Okowa, president of the federation who is also expected to present a detailed account of his stewardship in the last one year.
