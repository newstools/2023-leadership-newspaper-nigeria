Presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, he appealed to Nigeria not to vote along tribal/religious lines during the February 25 presidential election. He said the presidential election should be about capacity to salvage the country from its current mess and not about tribe or religion. Kwankwaso spoke yesterday in a special radio programme monitored in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. The NNPP presidential candidate said he possesses the best quality for the number one job in the country if elected. Kwankwaso said: “At least, people are talking about three or four of us as presidential candidates but Nigerians will be restricted to electing one of us as president. “I am sure he (Wike) will vote for the best and not necessarily somebody from the South or the North and that is what every responsible person, in my opinion, is talking about in this country. “Look, we are in a mess and everybody knows that. Mess in terms of insecurity; total mess in terms of economy.” The former Kano State governor stated that his team has already developed a blueprint to deal with challenges in different sectors of the economy. He said: “We are looking forward to addressing the issues we already have in our country from insecurity to economy, to education, to dilapidated infrastructure, to all other sectors. “So, together with Nigerians, by the grace of God, we will tackle all these issues and I have no doubt, based on my experiences in this country, we will be able to surmount all the issues that are today bedeviling the country.” Kwankwaso stated that with his experience, the issue of Boko Haram terrorist group will be dealt with.
