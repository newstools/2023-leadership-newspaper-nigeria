Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State and a philanthropist, Emmanuel Musa, have received security maintenance awards from the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) for their respective efforts in strengthening security in the state. They received the awards from outgoing Controller of the NIS in Adamawa State, Mohammed Falali, who is leaving office after 35 years in service. Handing the award to Fintiri through his Chief of Staff, Professor Maxwell Gidado, Falali said it was in recognition of Fintiri’s unrelenting fight against insecurity. “In my 35 years of service, I’ve never seen a governor so passionate about protecting the lives of the people like Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri,” Falali said. In his response, Governor Fintiri pledged that as chief security officer of the state, he would continue to ensure solid security for all. “You will always sleep with your two eyes closed,” Fintiri said in his message to the event. In the ceremony organised at the Adamawa State command of the NIS,  Dr. Emmanuel Musa was similarly given an award of service for his contributions to the Adamawa State Command of NIS. Emmanuel who is best known as president of Emnamu Foundation due to his philanthropist gestures through the foundation, was honoured for his humanitarian service. Falali said Emmanuel Musa’s contributions to the command and the humanitarian activities frequently carried out by his foundation were enormous, hence the award. In his response, Dr Musa who was represented by his chief of staff, Kukuya Godwin, appreciated the command for noticing his contributions to humanity, saying he would be further gingered to do more for the less privileged. He said the Emnamu Foundation was formed not to make any profit or seek political favours but purely to render service to  humanity.
