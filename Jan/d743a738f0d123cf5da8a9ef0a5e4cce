A savage new song by Shakira in which she ridiculed her former partner Gerard Piqué has logged more than 63 million YouTube views in 24 hours, making it the most watched new Latin song in the video platform’s history. Shakira and Piqué, who played for Barcelona, Manchester United and the Spanish national team, separated last year after more than a decade after birthing two children. The former centre-back, 35, has since begun a relationship with a 23-year-old woman, Clara Chía. In the diss track, a collaboration with the Argentine producer and DJ Bizarrap, Shakira, 45, sings: “I’m worth two 22-year-olds,” adding: “You swapped a Ferrari for a [Renault] Twingo/You swapped a Rolex for a Casio.” The singer also noted: “a she-wolf like me isn’t for rookies” … “I was out of your league, which is why you’re with someone just like you”, and she suggests her gym-loving ex should spend a little time training his brain, too. As well as punning references to Piqué and his new girlfriend, Shakira mentioned her mother-in-law, the media and her ongoing problems with the Spanish revenue authorities, who claimed she failed to pay €14.5m in taxes. “You left me with my mother-in-law as a neighbour, with the press at my door and a debt to the taxman,” she sang. So far, the song had racked up more than 63.5m views on YouTube, becoming the most watched new Latin music video in the platform’s history and making headlines around the world.
