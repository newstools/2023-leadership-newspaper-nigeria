The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has warned Nigerians against excessive fasting, saying it affects the kidney. Director-general of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, who gave the warning at a press briefing yesterday in Abuja, said “We are a very religious country, Muslims and Christians, we fast a lot, and it is part of the kidney problem. She said the body is supposed to have homeostasis balance, meaning the water level in your body must be enough to make the organs to function. “Some people will fast for 10, 20 days without drinking a lot of water. The kidney is being punished. “Now, if you put chemicals in it, it triples in an exponential manner, with damage to the kidneys. This is because the kidney does not have enough water to dilute and filter  Adeyeye added. She, therefore, urged Nigerians to fast with “common sense” and to always buy medications from pharmacies against buying from hawkers and corner shops.
