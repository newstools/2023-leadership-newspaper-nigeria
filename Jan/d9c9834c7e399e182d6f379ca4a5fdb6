The Zamfara All Progressives Congress (APC) Gubernatorial Campaign Council has said the party will win all the elections slated to hold in the state next month. He expressed confidence that the people of Zamfara will vote massively for all APC candidates, right from the presidential candidate to the state Assembly members. The APC director of publicity, Alhaji Ibrahim Danmaliki made the call while briefing newsmen on the activities of the party’s campaign team. Danmaliki however, welcomed the coming of the PDP governorship candidate into the race, stressing that APC never bothered about the contest of the PDP in the state. “Let’s all know that, APC never bothered about the PDP legal suit, as it was the member of the PDP that instituted the court case against the flag bearer,” he added. According to him, APC was pleased with the level of support people of the state demonstrated to it. He expressed confidence that the people of Zamfara would massively vote for all APC candidates, right from presidential candidate to the state Assembly members. The spokesman however maintained that APC would continue to conduct its campaigns devoid of rancour or attack on the opposition. He urged opposition political parties to imitate the ruling APC by conduct peaceful campaigns devoid of attacks and use of political thugs.
