Immediate past Osun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola yesterday charged the newly inaugurated Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), in Osun to intensify efforts towards ensuring all round victory for the All Progressives Congress (APC)  Presidential Candidate and his running mate and all APC candidates in the forthcoming general elections. Oyetola who is the State Coordinator, Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council reiterated that Osun would ensure the delivery of over a million votes for Bola Tinubu and Kashim Shettima in the next presidential election saying APC has offered the best candidate to turn around Nigeria’s fortunes. He noted that the country is in dire need of a competent individual like Tinubu to build on the gains of the incumbent administration and drive the the nation’s potential for socioeconomic growth and development of the country. According to him, there is no room for experiment on the choice of next president at this critical time in the history of Nigeria, hence the need to elect Tinubu whose political pedigree, good, responsible and responsive governance antecedents are second to none. Earlier, the acting State APC Chairman, Tajudeen Lawal, urged the party’s loyalists to begin door-to-door campaign and mobilisation of people to troop out en masse to elect and ensure victory for the party. Speaking in the same vein, Speaker, Osun House of Assembly, Hon. Timothy Owoeye expressed confidence in God that Oyetola would be victorious and returned as Osun Governor while Tinubu would also be elected the  next  president of the country. Owoeye who described the outcome of the July 16, 2022 Osun governorship as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC as a temporary setback, said God would soon return Oyetola back to govern the state for a second term before July this year.
