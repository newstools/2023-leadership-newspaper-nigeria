Analysts have said the Nigerian stock market is expected to close positive as investors seek bargain hunting opportunities. Notwithstanding, as the year begins to take shape, the January effect in the equities that has always been positive in the past years will likely drive the ongoing volatility for a longer period as investors are keeping an open eye on various macroeconomic data and the forthcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in January as well as the churn out of the fourth quarter (Q4) and full-year financials.  Analysts Optimism Analysts at Cordros Securities Limited said: “in the interim, we believe positioning for 2022 full year earnings releases and accompanying dividends declarations will continue to support buying activities on the local bourse even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the fixed income (FI) market. However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Afrinvest Limited added that, “this week, we anticipate a positive performance as investors seek bargain hunting opportunities.” Looking forward, United Capital Plc, anticipated robust market activity and bullish sentiments to continue briefly, saying, “the usual January momentum is likely to dominate in the near term, particularly as the yield environment appears to be shifting downwards. “We believe investors are likely to continue to favour the equities market even in Q1, 2023, as we estimate total sovereign maturities in Q1, 2023 will print at N2.3 trillion while total auctions (bonds and NT-bills) will likely hover around N1.7 trillion, creating excess liquidity of N555.2 billion. However, we see room for a brief bearish technical reversal in mid-January.” Going into the new week, analysts at Cowry Assets Management Limited anticipated mixed trend on profit taking and positive sentiment to pervade the market in the coming days as bargain hunting activities continues ahead of the January effects and volatility just as the market pullbacks add more strength to the upside potential of the index, saying, “however, we continue to advise investors to trade on companies’ stocks with sound fundamentals.”  Last Week’s Trading Activities After the positive close of 2022 in the spirit of a Santa Claus rally, the Lagos bourse opened for trading in 2023 on Tuesday with a positive close. However, it closed the week southward to halt the seven consecutive weeks of bullish transition occasioned by the pullback experienced mid-week due to sell-offs and profit-taking in some of the mid-large cap stocks. It is likely that the positive rally may linger for a long-time as listed companies continue notifying the exchange of their closed periods and planned board meetings.
