Saudi Arabia-based Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has confessed that he would love to play in the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) if only the league is well organised and matches are shown on television. The NPFL recently dropped 20 places in the latest ranking by IFFHS but the former Manchester United of England forward said he will retire to the domestic league if the security is improved upon. Poor officiating, hooliganism and corruption have marred the NPFL in recent years. “Our players abroad can come back to Nigeria but security must be improved upon. “The League (Nigerian Premier Football League) must be well organized. A lot of money will be pumped into the game and matches should be on television,” Ighalo said on Super Sport. Ighalo began his career for Julius Berger FC before moving to Europe, where he has scored 150 career goals in 354 domestic league appearances for 10 clubs.
