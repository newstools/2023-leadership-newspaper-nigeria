The Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has uncovered new plots by certain individuals and groups to malign its leadership and disrupt its activities over the firm determination not to succumb to frivolous requests which are grossly in violation of its mandate. It said individuals and groups who seek all forms of unholy sponsorship, support and patronage from the fund had in continuation of their campaign of calumny resorted to carrying out demonstrations and writing of frivolous petitions against the executive secretary over his continued stand not to compromise his office. It said while the schemes of the individuals and groups are not unexpected, as they have become almost traditional, it is important to call the attention of stakeholders and the general public to avoid attendant distractions that may arise. In a statement by Abdulmumin Oniyangi, the acting director, public affairs of TETFund, the management said the  increasing confidence being reposed in the fund by critical stakeholders and indeed the general public as a result of the impactful reforms introduced in the past year to enhance greater efficiency and quality service delivery, it would not under any circumstance betray public trust. “The executive secretary and his team would continue to focus on the needs of the fund’s beneficiary institutions classified under the TETFund Establishment Act of 2011 as public universities, polytechnics and colleges of education, as well as other specific mandates of the agency. “We, therefore, use this opportunity to reassure our stakeholders and the general public that TETFund is being run with a deep sense of responsibility. The executive secretary remains committed to providing quality, accountable and exemplary leadership and will not be distracted in any way whatsoever, by any mischievous plot,” the statement said.
