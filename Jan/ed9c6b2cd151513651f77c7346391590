 Justice Daniel Osiagor of the Federal High Court in Lagos has convicted and sentenced a 24-year-old man, Yusuf Taofeek, to five years’ imprisonment, for unlawful transportation of 4, 238.29 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa, popularly called marijuana. Justice Osiagor sent Taofeek to jail after he pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of conspiracy to transport and unlawful transportation of the prohibited leaves, made against him by the men of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Earlier, the prosecutor, Lambert Nor, had informed the court that the convict had on December 11, 2022, at 2nd Toll Gate, Opposite Victoria Gardens City Estate, Lekki, Lagos, conspired with some others now at large, and transported 4,238.29 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa. Nor told the court that the convict and others at large used a White/Blue Benz 814 Truck with Reg. No. AGL 156 YA; Chassis No. WDB67401315813397 and Engine No. A 366901102258506, to unlawfully convey the illicit substance. The lawyer saidthe offences contravened sections 14 (b) and 11(b) of the NDLEA Act Cap N 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, and are punishable under the same Act. He also reviewed the facts of the charge and tendered some exhibits, which included the extrajudicial statement of the convict and samples of the seized drugs. They were all admitted by the court. Nor then urged the court to sentence him under the sections of the law for which he was charged. The prosecutor also moved an application for the final forfeiture of the Mercedes Benz truck used by the convict to illegally transport the Cannabis Sativa. He submitted to the court that the application was under sections 3(c); 31(a); 32(c); 33; 34 and section 36 of the NDLEA Act Cap. N30 LFN 2004. The lawyer also cited Section 42 of the Constitution Of Nigeria 1999; Order 26 Rule 8 Of The Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009 and the court’s inherent jurisdiction to back up his request. However, the defence lawyer, Robert Nyeri, urged the court to grant her client an option of a fine instead of a custodial sentence.  Justice Osiagor in his judgment sentenced the convict to five years imprisonment on each of the counts.  While the judge directed that the jail terms should run concurrently, he, however, gave the convict an option of a N1 million fine, instead of the custodian sentence.  He also ordered that the blue/white Mercedes Benz truck used by the convict to transport the cannabis sativa, be forfeited to the federal government.
