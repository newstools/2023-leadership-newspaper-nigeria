Ondo State governor, Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, on Saturday, joined other eminent personalities to bid Mama Caroline Olutola Jegede farewell.  The late Caroline Jegede, mother of a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in the State, Mr. Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, died at the age of 96.  Governor Akeredolu and other dignitaries including a former Governor of the State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, attended the funeral service held at The Cathedral of St David, Ijomu, Akure, the State capital.  LEADERSHIP reports that this was first time Governor Akeredolu will appear in public since after the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential campaign rally in Akure about two weeks ago and since after the report about his ill-health.  Members of the State Executive Council (SEC) led by the Secretary to the State Government, Princess Oladunni Odu, also attended the funeral service.  Governor Akeredolu described late Mama Jegede as a woman of substance who lived a fulfilled life.  In his sermon, Bishop of Akure Anglican Diocese and Archbishop of Ondo Ecclesiastical Province, Most Rev’d Simeon Borokini, spoke on “Victory Assured”.  He described Governor Akeredolu as a leader who plays politics without bitterness.  “From what we are witnessing here today, we are confident that political party can no longer divide us in Ondo State.  “You know the party of our Governor, you know the party of Eyitayo Jegede. And you will remember that they both contested the governorship elections twice. We know that in Ondo State, we are experiencing peace. Politics will not divide us. We are writing history,” the cleric stated.
