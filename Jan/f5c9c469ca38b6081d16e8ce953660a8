Imo State government has accused the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of plotting to truncate democracy in the state by calling for the declaration of a state of emergency.
In a reaction to a press conference held by the PDP where it called on the federal government to declare a state of emergency in the state, should insecurity persist, the state government blamed the party for the security breaches because it is still bitter that it lost the 2019 governorship election in the state.
In a statement issued by the commissioner for information and strategy, Hon Declan Emelumba, the government said the PDP has been a sour loser bent on rocking the boat, after it was sacked by the Supreme Court in 2020.
It said the suggestion by the PDP was a smokescreen to cover its real intention of destabilising the state with a view to stopping the 2023 election.
“The Imo PDP has never hidden its unpatriotic desire to truncate the democratically elected Government of Senator Hope Uzodimma,” the statement averred.
“They sponsored and contrived insecurity in the state to make the state ungovernable, as they had vowed after they were lawfully booted out of office,” it further noted.
The government said it has been working assiduously to contain the situation which has not spiralled out of control.
It said contrary to the claims of the PDP, the government has not been intimidating the opposition, pointing out that both the PDP presidential candidate and his Labour Party counterpart had campaigned in the state without any untoward incident.
According to it, the PDP is afraid of contesting the upcoming elections because it knows that it can never defeat the APC.
The government said the PDP has been suffering a self-inflicted internal crisis such that the party is almost dead.
The state government asked the federal government to ignore the PDP as its desire is to overthrow Governor Uzodimma in a violent manner instead of going for an election.
