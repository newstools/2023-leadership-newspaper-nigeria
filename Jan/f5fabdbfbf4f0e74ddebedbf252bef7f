West Ham captain, Declan Rice, has emerged as Arsenal’s top target ahead of this summer window. Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta, is ready to break the club’s transfer record to sign the England international. Rice looks set to leave the Hammers this summer, with the club asking £100million. However, the East London club might not get up to that fee. Chelsea, who recently beat Arsenal to the signing of Shakhtar Donetsk forward Mykhailo Mudryk, were thought to be in pole position to sign Rice this summer. But Arsenal believe they are in pole position to beat their rivals to Rice’s signature this summer. The league leaders have all but confirmed their place in next season’s Champions League and a big part of Rice’s ambition is to play in Europe’s top club competition. The Blues, however, sit in 10th place and may miss out on the Premier League top four.
