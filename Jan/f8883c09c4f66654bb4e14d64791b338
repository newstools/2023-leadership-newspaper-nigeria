Ondo State Governor  Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has expressed optimism that the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will win the 2023 presidential election. Akeredolu said the APC is lucky to have a personality like Tinubu as its Presidential candidate. The governor, who described Asiwaju Tinubu as reliable and competent, added that he is the only candidate that can engender desired change and development in the country. Akeredolu spoke in Ondo town at the Central Senatorial District campaign rally of the APC in the State. The rally was in continuation of the Senatorial Rally of the party which was flagged off last week Monday in Okitipupa, Ondo South Senatorial District. Addressing a large crowd of party leaders, members, and supporters at the rally held at Our Saviours Primary School, Esso Area, Ondo, Governor Akeredolu canvassed votes for all candidates of the party. His words:” Tinubu will be elected as the President. Should we be looking for someone else in Sokoto or Adamawa when we have a reliable and competent person amongst us? We are lucky to have Asiwaju Tinubu in APC. He will win.” The governor enjoined the people to vote for the Senatorial candidate of the party in Ondo Central, Mr. Niyi Adegbonmire, SAN, popularly known as Omo-Ekun.  He said Adegbonmire has the capacity and competence to bring quality representation to the people of Ondo Central.
