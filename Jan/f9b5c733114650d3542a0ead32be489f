 Ahead of this yearâ€™s general elections, a well-known singer in Bauchi State, Andy Bature, has led G-11 APC singers from the party to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mr Andy and other singers commonly referred to as G-11 have been working with the APC for nearly a decade and sang many popular songs for the party and its presidential and governorship candidates in Bauchi. Speaking when he was received at the Bauchi PDP gubernatorial campaign council office, Andy said, lack of focus and preferential treatment to members forced them out of the All Progressives Congress (APC), adding that they will be loyal to existing Bauchi PDP structures to contribute their quota to the success of the party at the poll. He said G-11 singers are fully behind the reelection bid of governor Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir considering the plethora of life-impacting developmental projects he brought to the people of the state during his first tenure as governor. Receiving the G-11, deputy-general in charge of operations of the 2023 Bauchi PDP campaign council, Abdulrazak Nuhu Zaki said the Bala Mohammed led-administration would continue to support and carry everybody along in its effort to provide the citizenry with dividends of democracy for the development of Bauchi State. He added the successes his administration has recorded shall be attributed to the tremendous support, contributions and prayers from the masses, saying more will be delivered in his second tenure to ensure that the Bauchi Renewal Project is actualised.
