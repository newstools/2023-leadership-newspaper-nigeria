The federal government has commenced the construction of 116 housing units of two-bedroom semi-detached bungalows at Gwagwalada area council in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to ease the housing deficit of federal civil servants in the territory.
The project is being undertaken through the office of the head of Service of the Federation, Federal Integrated Staff Housing (FISH) progamme.
The head of Service of the Federation, Dr. Folasade Yemi-Esan, in her keynote address at the groundbreaking ceremony organised by the OHCSF in partnership with the Federal Government Staff Housing Loans Board (FGSHLB), reiterated that the FISH programme came on board to mitigate housing deficits amongst civil servants.
Yemi-Esan while appreciating the Ministry of Works and Housing for providing land that spans about five hectares in a prime area of the Gwagwalada area council of the FCT, also hoped for more houses for civil servants soon.
The head of the service further intimated to the audience that her office is looking towards adopting modern technologies and solutions, which are acceptable the world over for the construction of affordable and durable abodes for civil servants.
Also, the minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammad Bello, who was represented by the permanent secretary of FCTA, Olusola Adesola, noted that the infrastructural policy of the federal government has continually ensured that residents of the FCT and by extension, civil servants have decent accommodation.
Similarly, the minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fasola, while commending the leadership qualities of the HoS in ensuring that things get done at the appropriate time, promised to allocate more land, to achieve the infrastructural policy mandate of the federal government.
