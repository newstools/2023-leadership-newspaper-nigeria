Nigeria’s Flying Eagles failed to advance to the final of the ongoing 7th Africa U20 Cup of Nations (AFCON) after losing their semifinal match 0-1 to The Gambia’s Young Lions at the Cairo International Stadium Monday’s evening. Lanky forward Adama Bojang capitalised on a defensive slip by captain Daniel Bameyi to slot beyond goalkeeper Chijioke Aniagboso for the only goal of the match in the 7th minute. Nigeria’s rapid raiders Ibrahim Muhammad, Samson Lawal, Haliru Sarki and Francis Abubakar failed to get their strikes on target, and in the second half, Belgium-based forward Ahmed Abdullahi struck the base of the upright from the penalty spot as the Flying Eagles put every foot wrong. Defender Benjamin Frederick showed grit and intention in the 77th minute but his efforts were foiled close to goal. Two minutes into added time, Onuche Ogbelu’s rising shot rose too high.
