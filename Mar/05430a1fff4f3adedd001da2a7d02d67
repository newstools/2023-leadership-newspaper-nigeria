The general assembly of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has ratified the immediate dissolution of the Rivers State chapter of the council for gross misconduct in flagrant violation of the provisions of the 2021 Revised Code of Conduct. The decision was reached after a meeting held on March 9, 2023. The council also condemned the endorsement of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate by the Rivers State chapter of IPAC. This is contained in a statement yesterday by the national secretary, Yusuf Dantalle. INEC chairman, Rivers State REC, state commissioner of Police and the director, Department of State Services (DSS) were notified about the development. The statement said the Inter-Party Advisory Council is not a political party but a platform for all political parties saddled with the mandate of promoting and defending the interests of all registered political parties in Nigeria, hence should be neutral, fair and impartial. The council condemned and dissociated itself from the alleged irresponsible act of the Rivers State IPAC executives in endorsing the Rivers State PDP governorship candidate, Sir Siminialaye Fubara. “Let it also be unequivocally stated that those behind this scripted spectacle are as irresponsible as those who have been used as political pawns. “All political parties whose party officials in Rivers State have been found culpable are enjoined to take disciplinary actions in accordance with their respective party constitutions. “Conclusively, we call on the good people of Rivers State to disregard these political renegades and vote for candidates of their choice,” IPAC said.
