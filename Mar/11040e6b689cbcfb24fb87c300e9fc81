Novak Djokovic impressed as he beat Tallon Griekspoor in straight sets to reach the Dubai Tennis Championships quarter-finals. The 22-time Grand Slam champion, taken to three sets by qualifier Tomas Machac on Tuesday, beat the Dutchman 6-2 6-3. “It’s been a great evening for me,” said Djokovic. The Serbian world number one will face fifth seed Hubert Hurkacz or Pavel Kotov on Thursday for a place in the semis. Djokovic is chasing a sixth Dubai title and is playing his first tournament since winning the Australian Open with a hamstring injury last month. Defending champion Andrey Rublev saved five match points and recovered from a set down to advance. The second seed beat Spaniard Alejandro Davdovich Fokina 1-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-3) and will now face Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands in the last eight on Thursday. His hard fought win was in marked contrast to Djokovic, who recovered from a shaky first-round display to put in a ruthless display against Griekspoor. “Yesterday, I really had to work hard to get a win,” said Djokovic..
