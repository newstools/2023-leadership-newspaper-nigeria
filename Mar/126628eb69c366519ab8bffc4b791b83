A chieftian of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Chief Tony Okocha, has called on youths in the State, to beware of failed and desperate politicians from the State, who are preaching against the interest of Rivers.  Okocha, who is a former Chief of Staff, Government House, Port Harcourt, made the call on Friday while speaking at a one-day youth summit in Port Harcourt, the state capital.  The summit, with the theme: “Linking The Future of Rivers Youths To The Dreams Of Our Founding Fathers”, was organised by a non-governmental organization, Rivers For Rivers Network (RFRN) and the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN).  He said: “Youths of our dear Rivers State, resist roughshods that will threaten our existence. Pussilanimity in the face of “non-sequitors” that make us no less, slaves in our communities, villages, towns and state, is not only a vice, but unforgivable sacrilege.  “I charge you to discountenance the lure by failed and desperate politicians from our state, who maraud our villages, communities and towns, preaching against the interest of our people and state in the useless bid to curry inordinate political favours.”  Presenting a paper titled: “From Eastern Region of Nigeria To Rivers State: A Brief History”, a lecturer at the University of Port Harcourt, Dr. Gift Worlu, said corruption, domination and annihilation started in Nigeria with the splitting of the country into only four regions.  Worlu said: “Corruption started from the creation of four regions; Western Region, Northern Region, Eastern Region and Mid-Western Region. Domination started from the creation of the regions and annihilation started with the creation of the regions.  “At that time, our people, the Rivers people were not represented at the Eastern House of Assembly. It was the Wellington Commission that later gave Rivers people a chance to be represented.”
