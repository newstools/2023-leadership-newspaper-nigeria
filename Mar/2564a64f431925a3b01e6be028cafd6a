The Labour Party, (LP), has intensified its campaign following postponement of the governorship election by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, saying it is determined to win the governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state. The Director-General of Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Mr. Akin Osuntokun while speaking to journalists in Lagos said the Labour Party is expanding its structure and vowed to defeat the incumbent Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in the Governorship election next week. Osuntokun spoke in Lagos during a youth rally tagged, “Youth O’Clock Breakfast Meeting with Peter Obi and Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour.” It would be recalled that LP defeated the APC and PDP to win Lagos in the Presidential election. “When you are dealing with desperadoes, those are the kinds of things you hear, those who are saying that we are afraid, they are frightened because they know they lost in Lagos by a wide margin that is embarrassing to them. I am not surprised that they have resorted to demonization. This is a way of desperadoes. “The true results of previous elections showed that more Yorubas voted for Peter Obi than the Igbo people. “Labour Party would not only repeat its victory in the governorship election, it would improve on it. The way the votes have been mutilated has made people very angry and radicalized with the position they have taken. “I have taken samples all over the place. People are going out to vote. Nigeria has gotten to a stage where people are now aware that they have to take their destiny in their hands…” Spokesman of the Obi-Datti Campaign Council, Dr. Yunusa Tanko declared that the evolution of Lagos has started, saying nobody can lay claim to building Lagos. “Lagos was built with the instrumentality of give and take and collective input. The Nigerian youths helped to build Lagos. Gbadebo is your own,” he said.
