Chief Philip Agbese, the member-elect representing Ado/Okpokwu/Ogbadigbo federal constituency of Benue State, has congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as President-elect.  Agbese said Tinubu’s victory was historic, describing it as a “big win for Nigerians and defeat for enemies of the nation who are out to truncate our nascent democracy.”  He also congratulated other winners at the just-concluded polls, including his soon-to-be colleagues at the National Assembly, describing the development as a new dawn in the nation.  The human rights activist spoke shortly after Tinubu received his certificate of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Wednesday.  Agbese said the tasks before Tinubu were enormous, hence the former Lagos State Governor must hit the ground running quickly.  He added that the incoming president must justify the trust bestowed on him by Nigerians and unify the nation at a critical time where it is leaning towards religious lines.  The media entrepreneur said the president-elect must work for all Nigerians irrespective of any inclination and must be a father to all.  While expressing confidence in the capacity, track record, and competence of Tinubu to bring ‘renewed hope’, peace, progress, and prosperity to Nigeria, Agbese also urged him to be magnanimous in victory.  He reckoned that the struggle for a greater nation rests squarely on the new crop of leaders elected across Nigeria.  Agbese, therefore, called on his fellow officials to give their best to the nation as anything short will be unaccepted by the electorates.  He said Nigerians have toiled enough and now is the time to forge a new cause of development and progress.  The member-elect, however, pledged that the 10th National Assembly will support the President-elect to deliver.
