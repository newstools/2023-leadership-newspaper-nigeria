Members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imota, in Ikorodu local government area of Lagos State have protested the action of the town’s monarch, Oba Mudashiru Agoro, who allegedly engaged Oro cult group in the community to place curses on any member of the community that vote against the  All Progressives Congress (APC). The traditional ruler Oba Agoro, the Ranodu of Imota, was said to have engaged members of Oro cult last Friday to place curses on any member of the community that will vote against APC in the governorship and House of Assembly elections on Saturday. The PDP House of Assembly candidate for Ikorodu constituency 1 Prince Adewale Oyebo who led the protest said it had become the attitude of the monarch to be partisan, saying as the king he ought to be a father to everybody. Speaking on the protest cum rally which saw the protesters go round the entire community renouncing the curses, Oyebo said, “It was a good protest and rally, in this our community, Imota, Igbogbo, Ijede, Ibeshe, the king supposed not to be engaged in partisan politics, but in these communities mentioned the kings are intimidating the electorate, the Ranodu of Imota even went to the extent of engaging members of Oro cult, to place curse on anybody that did not vote for the  APC candidates in the forthcoming election. ‘’We are out to assure the electorate that the curse won’t have effect on them and that they should vote the PDP enmasse and that the curse would boomerang and be the portion of those who placed the curse. “The monarch was only interested in his personal gains, but not interested in the welfare of the masses,” he said.
