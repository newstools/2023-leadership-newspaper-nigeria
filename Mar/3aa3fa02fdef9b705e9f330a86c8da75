The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (APCPCC) and the Tinubu-Shettima Grassroot Independent Campaign Council (TSGICC) in Rivers State, have declared that they never agreed to vote for the preferred gubernatorial candidate of Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike in the March 11 elections in the state. A top member of the two groups, Chief Tony Okocha, had while addressing journalists in Port Harcourt on Thursday, urged members and supporters of the party in the state, to vote for the governor’s preferred choice in the March 11, 2023 governorship election in appreciation for his support towards the emergence of APC’s Bola Tinubu as president-elect. But, in a swift reaction, the APCPCC and the TSGICC, in a statement signed by the state coordinator, Sir Augustine Nwokocha and two others, said Okocha spoke for himself and not for the two groups and APC members in the state. The statement read in part: “Our attention has been drawn to a press conference held by Chief Anthony C. Okocha and the statement made therein, purportedly for and on behalf of APC PCC/TSGICC Rivers State. “However, we join Chief Okocha to congratulate our president-elect, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu; his vice, Senator Kashim Shetima and our party, the APC, for this historic victory against a very distractive and vehemently divisive campaign and the natural vagaries of our humanity (age and ill-health).”
