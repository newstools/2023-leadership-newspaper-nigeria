Ajayi similarly noted that cinemas experienced an all time lull in the week of the Presidential and National Assembly elections.

We lost a weekend of sales during the Presidential and National Assembly elections, Nigerians’ attention was focused on voting across the country.” “Cash crunch and POS failures, affecting trading generally is also affecting the cinemas. “Many movie producers and distributors avoided releasing movies during the election period. So, content was also somewhat limited,” he said. Ajayi said the top films exhibited in cinemas across the country in February were “Antman” and “Love in a pandemic”. He listed films to watch out for in the month of March as : “Creed III”, “What love got to do with it”, “Shazam fury of the gods”, “John Wick iv”, “Different strokes” and “Dungeons and Dragons83”
