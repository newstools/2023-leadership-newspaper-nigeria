The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) through the Department of Development Control (DDC) says it has served all relevant notices and marked structures of illegal estates springing up in Apo and Lugbe districts in the territory for massive demolition. The FCTA which alerted residents on the proliferation of illegal housing estates and other developments along Idu Train Station, Apo Tapi and Lugbe areas within the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), advised residents to be careful with illegal developers who are out to deceive innocent residents with fake land documents. The director, Development Control, Mukhtar Galadima, who made this known yesterday, said the alarm became necessary due to the rising adverts on social media by land grabbers and illegal developers of housing estates. Galadima explained that these areas had not yet been detailed with design layouts, but people were carrying fake title documents that they were being allocated by AMAC. He added that it was against development rules and regulations for somebody while in the course of implementing his or her plan to change it without recourse to seeking approval for a modified plan. The director further noted that with the constitution of the FCT Urban and Planning Tribunal, land grabbing and other menaces would be reduced, as there would be prosecution of defaulters. He also revealed that developers of illegal structures and land grabbers would be made to pay for the cost of demolition and afterwards be handed over to the police forÂ  prosecution.
