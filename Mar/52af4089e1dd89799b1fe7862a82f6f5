Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has applauded Nigerians for supporting the return of power to the Southern part of the country in the just-concluded 2023 presidential election. He said the issue of rotational presidency has been settled for good with the emergence of a President-elect, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is from the Southern region of the country. Wike spoke on Friday when he accompanied his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde, to commission the 5,000,000-litre Aviation Fuel Dispensing Depot at the Ibadan Airport in the Alakia area of Oyo State. The governor expressed delight that Makinde was one of those that backed power shift to the South after the eight-year tenure of the incumbent Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, who is from Katsina State in the North-West geopolitical zone. He said, “I am happy he (Makinde) is one of those that made history by making sure that power shift to the South. “I have told people that those who fight for change, who fight for revolution may not be directed beneficiaries of that fight but today, history has it that all of us now are aware that when power finishes from the south, it will go to the north; when it finishes from the north, it will come to the south. “So, it does not need to be written in the constitution at all before it is implemented. And I thank Nigerians for standing firm to see that this issue materialise.”
