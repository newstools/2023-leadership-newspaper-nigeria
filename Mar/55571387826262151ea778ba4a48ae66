Ahead of the forthcoming governorship and state assembly elections, the Benue State chairman of Young Progressives Party (YPP)  Dr  Gwadue Hough, has disclosed that the party has gone into an alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to enable the party’s gubernatorial candidate win the  election. Dr Hough who made this known during a press conference in Makurdi stated that the party had decided to align with the PDP on the governorship position because the 100,000 votes YPP is sure of would not win election. “We in YPP, we are optimistic of getting 100,000 votes across the  23 local governments councils in the state and knowing fully well that we cannot win the election with that we decided to collapse our structures with the PDP for an overwhelming victory. “By doing this it simply means we have gone all out to contribute our quota to the building of the state in the next four years,” Hough stated He warned  that the party would not hesitate to stand against the PDP whenever the party fails in her social engagements with the Benue people. “This alliance should not be a parasitic one but a symbiotic one where there will be mutual  relationship and understanding that will be beneficial to all,” he added. He enjoined members of the party to work assiduously to deliver on the mandate of ensuring that the PDP would wins the election.
