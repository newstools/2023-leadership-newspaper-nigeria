Ahead of the gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections scheduled for March 11, 2023, the Kaduna State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) is seeking collaboration with other political parties in the State in order to oust the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).  Recall that the PDP won Saturday’s presidential election, the three Senatorial seats and several House of Representatives seats in Kaduna State.  PDP State chairman, Hon. Felix Hassan Hyet, stated this while addressing journalists at the party’s secretariat in Kaduna.  While commending the people of the state for the massive support shown during the presidential and National Assembly elections across the 23 Local Government Areas (LGAs), Hon. Hyet solicited for more support during the forthcoming governorship election by coming out with more vigour in order to wrestle power back to the people from the APC.  According to him, the defeat suffered by the ruling APC in the state was a sign of total rejection of the APC-led government in Kaduna State by the good people of the state.  “I want to thank the good people of Kaduna state for coming out en-mass to vote for PDP. I am proud to say that the influence and confidence of the people of Kaduna State was clearly demonstrated through the outcome of the elections.  “For the first time in the history, PDP clinched the three senatorial seats, and 10 out of the 16 federal constituencies in the state. More to that, in 2019 general elections, PDP produced the highest number of votes for our presidential candidate, and same was repeated in the just concluded elections,” PDP chairman averred.  Hyet further explained that PDP in the state was not leaving any stone unturned to ensure that PDP emerge victorious in the coming elections while stressing that synergy with other parties was key in the actualisation of the dream.
