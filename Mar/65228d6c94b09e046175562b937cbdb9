The board of the company recommended a final dividend of US2.5 cents per share for the financial year 2022 and following a review of Seplat’s operational, liquidity and financial position post refinancing the board has decided to declare an additional special dividend of US5.0 cents per share to be paid after approval at the annual general meeting (AGM) which will be held on May 10, 2023. This brings the total dividend declared for 2022 to US15 cents per share higher than US10 cents per share in 2021. The payment of the special dividend reflects the board’s confidence in the future of the business and is underpinned by a strong balance sheet.

Gross profit increased by 63.0 per cent to $464.7 million compared to $285.2 million in 2021 and benefitted from higher realised oil prices.

Strong balance sheet with $404.3 million cash at bank, net debt of $365.9 million and a full year production cost of $10.3/boe. Speaking on the performance, chief executive officer of Seplat Energy, Roger Brown said:  “I am delighted that our strong financial performance will enable the payment of a US7.5 cent final dividend, despite the significantly disrupted production we experienced in the second half of the year. The full-year dividend of US15 cents represents a dividend yield of around 11 per cent at the current LSE share price.” He added that, “as we enter 2023, the business is in a very healthy state, with new wells coming onstream, encouraging appraisal drilling underway at Sibiri, and alternative export routes ensuring good export performance in January and February this year. “Our gas business continues to develop, with first gas expected from ANOH in Q4 this year, and we are now in the process of separating our Midstream Gas business from the Upstream unit to unlock new value for shareholders.”
