Former deputy chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, has raised the alarm over plot to secretly eliminate the governorship candidate of Labour Party (LP) in Lagos State, Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour. He called on the security agencies to brace up and ensure a non-violent poll on Saturday, March 11, 2023. George who made the allegation while speaking under the auspices of Omo Eko Pataki, an umbrella body of prominent Lagos indigenes, warned that should anything happen to the LP candidate, who he described as “this vibrant bonafide Lagosian,” Nigerians should know who to hold. Briefing journalists at his Ikoyi office which was attended by former deputy governor of Lagos State, Sen. Kofoworola Buknor-Akerele; Chief Onikepo Oshodi, Dr. Lai Ogunbambi, among others, George said Lagosians won’t accept a repeat of the murder of the former PDP governorship candidate, Engr Funsho Williams, which happened in the build-up to 2007 general elections. He said  the concern being raised by him had nothing to do with political affiliation, saying as a bonafide Lagosians, “We wish to inform Nigerians about the heinous plan to secretly eliminate the Labour Party governorship candidate, Mr. Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour, the latest move by the Lagos occupiers, to take him out of circulation before the election on Saturday. “We, hereby, warn that should anything happen to this vibrant bonafide Lagosian, whose fate has been thrown up to free our dear state from the stranglehold of marauders, Nigerians should know who to hold,” George said. George warned those threatening to unleash havoc on non-indigenes who may vote against the ruling party in the state, the All Progressives Congress (APC)  in the  governorship election that will be held on Saturday to perish such thought.
