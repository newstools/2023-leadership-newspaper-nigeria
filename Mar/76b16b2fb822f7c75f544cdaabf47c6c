Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina says God has shamed those who think the North will not deliver the president-elect, Ahmed Bola Tinubu. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday declared Tinubu winner of last Saturday’s presidential election. Briefing pressmen after Tinubu was declared winner of the Saturday presidential election. The governor expressed happiness with the conduct and the turnout of residents of Katsina State and massively voted for the APC at all elective positions, adding that the party won 3 senatorial seats and 9 out of the 15 house of representatives seats in the state. Believing that Bola Ahmad Tinubu has the capacity and the brain to galvanise resources and propel them to greater heights for the pride of all the blacks, expressing optimism that just like the president-elect has overturned the situation of Lagos to a peaceful and economically viable state, he would do for Nigerians. He said, “Those who think we can’t deliver, God has shamed them because we have delivered. “My appeal to the Katsina is that let them scale the Governorship candidates and I’m sure they will vote for the APC candidate Dr Umar Radda. He is more than qualified; he has the capacity because he has been tested and has delivered.” Masari said INEC should not try to impress the international community, reiterating that no election is perfect, he said even though the just concluded election was not itch-free, that was not enough to undermine the integrity and quality of the election.
