The Muhammadu Buhari Osinbajo Dynamic Support Group has described the victory of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Senator Bola Tinubu, as a proof of advancement in Nigeria. In a statement issued in Abuja by its national coordinator, Hon Usman Ibrahim, the group commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for “making the votes of Nigerian people count.” Ibrahim, who is a chieftain of the APC said, “The party fielded a sellable candidate in the person of Tinubu as well as his running mate, Senator Kashim Shettima and the import of our good thinking is the victory at hand. “A Tinubu presidency will deepen democracy as a fulcrum of socio-economic development,” it added. In this vein, the APC support group urged political parties, other critical stakeholders “to as a matter of patriotism join hands in the onerous task of moving the nation forward.” “There is no perfect democracy anywhere in the world. Therefore, we call on the opposition to focus on the merits of last Saturday’s presidential poll and eschew any act capable of derailing our democratic gains since the country returned to civil rule in 1999. “Every contest must produce losers and winners. In any case the fact that a candidate lost does not foreclose the fact that he/she can win another time,” the group stated. It pointed out that the emergence of four front runners in the just concluded presidential election is “a derivative from the level playing ground provided by the Buhari’s administration.”
