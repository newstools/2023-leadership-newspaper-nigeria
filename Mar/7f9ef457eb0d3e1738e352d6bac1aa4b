While confirming the development, the police public relations officer Wasiu Abiodun said based on the information received a “police patrol team led by DPO Bosso Division mobilised to the area and the informant led the police to the building. “Unfortunately, on entering the building and based on preliminary investigation, it was discovered that the information was untrue,” Abiosun said.
