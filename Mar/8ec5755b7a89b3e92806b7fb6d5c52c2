 No fewer than 400 beneficiaries of the skills acquisition training organised by the Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi Charitable Foundation have on graduation received a boost with the donation of N2 million by the secretary to the state government (SSG), Barr. Ibrahim Kassim. Kassim, who made the donation said it was to empower the beneficiaries to enhance their trades or economic activities. The SSG who enumerated a number of development projects executed by the Kauran Bauchi-led administration in tailoring the needs of the electorates, called on the people generally to vote for the PDP in the forthcoming gubernatorial election on 11th March, 2023. Also, in a goodwill message, the wife of the governor, A’isha Bala Mohammed similarly empowered the beneficiaries with ten bags each of rice, maize, millet, beans, 20 bundles of women wrappers, as well as cash of N1million. The governor’s wife, who was represented at the event by the wife of the state deputy governor, Amina Baba Tela called on beneficiaries of the training to vote for Governor Bala Mohammed for a second term in office. She commended the chairman of the foundation, Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi for establishing the body and prayed for his good health, even as she urged eligible voters to vote for her husband in the 11th March polls. Earlier, the state SUBEB chairman, Dr Sirumbai Dahiru Bauchi expressed regret that past governments in the state provided money as empowerment to the people only to spend them on frivolities. He recalled that as a result of banditry activities, communal clashes, ethno-religious conflicts and other skirmishes, hundreds of wives and children lost their breadwinners.
