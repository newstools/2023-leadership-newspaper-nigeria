The current Tottenham boss has a contract with the club until 2024 but he has admitted to still being in “love” with Italy and is a rumoured target for Inter. A possible return to his former club Juventus has also been mooted, with Conte having endured a tough season in north London. both on and off the pitch. The Italian has been away from the touchline in recent weeks after gallbladder surgery, but is expected to return for the second leg of Spurs’ Champions League last-16 tie against Milan. After leaving Spurs, Pochettino managed Paris Saint-Germain for one and half years, but has been out of work since being dismissed by the club last summer. He is the only manager in Tottenham’s history to guide the club to a Champions League final, which they lost against Liverpool in the 2018-19 season.
