All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate for Ohafia North state constituency, Hon Uchenna Onuoha, has said that he remains the most reliable hope for the constituency and the people. Onuoha stated this in an exclusive interview with LEADERSHIP in Umuahia, the Abia State capital yesterday as the March 11 governorship and State Assembly elections draw closer. “I am the best positioned candidate to bring succour to the constituency and the people if elected,” he said, adding that the time for the people to make the right choice had arrived. He said it is unfortunate that successive administrations in the state have over the years neglected the constituency even as it had contributed massively to elect them. “They remember us only when they need our votes and thereafter, they will abandon and forget us to suffer in abject poverty while our unemployed youths continue to suffer,” he lamented. Onuoha, explained that if elected he would address the challenges which include infrastructure decay, youth unemployment, insecurity, marginalisation, and underdevelopment among others. “I can assure you that with me representing the constituency, the desired dividends of democracy which have over the years eluded the people will be made available for them,” he said. He dismissed the assertion that legislators are not adequately positioned and empowered to attract much development in their capacities but are more concerned with law making. “It is a matter of individual connection, knowing who to contact and the right buttons to press,” he said, adding that, “the notion that legislators have less to do to attract democracy dividends is absurd and archaic.”
