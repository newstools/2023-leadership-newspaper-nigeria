President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled the death of foremost politician and businessman, Alhaji Musa Musawa, a one-time Senator, saying the nation mourns the loss of a political giant and a true Nigerian. President Buhari in a statement by his media aide, Garba Shehu, on Wednesday, described the deceased as “a towering grassroots politician with a nuanced understanding of matters who had very few parallels as a campaigner in his heydays.” “He lived a worthy life, leaving us with innumerable happy memories of accomplishments as a politician, businessman and a community leader. We will miss him a lot,” said the President. “May Allah repose his soul and grant fortitude to his family and the government and people of Katsina State to bear the loss,” President Buhari added.
