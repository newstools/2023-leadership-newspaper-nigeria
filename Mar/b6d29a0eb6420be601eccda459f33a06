Justice Ismail Ijelu of the Lagos State High Court sitting in Lagos has dismissed a fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by a Lagos-based businesswoman, Happiness Akile, against the Inspector-General of Police and four others, for lacking in merit and without substance. Justice Ijelu also ordered the businesswoman, and her company, UMZ Venture Resources, to pay the sum of N50,000 each to the first and fourth respondents in the suit. Others favoured by the court’s orders were: the Lagos State Commissioner Of Police; the Osun State Commissioner Of Police; Supol Eludire Clement, and Olak Roofing Nigeria Limited, listed as second to fifth respondents in the suit numbered ID/14466MFR/2022. The applicant has, in her fundamental rights enforcement suit, asked the court for the following reliefs: “a declaration that the threat to arrest and detain her by the respondents without any genuine allegation of having or being about to commit any crime amounts to infringement and breach of her fundamental rights. “A declaration that the blocking of her business bank account (Fidelity bank: Account no. 5600748621: UMZ Venture Resources) by the respondents without any just cause is an unlawful, illegal and brazen violation of the Applicant’s fundamental right as entrenched in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). “General, compensatory, exemplary and aggravated damages of N2 million naira, awarded against the respondents jointly and severally for the threat and actual violation of the Applicant’s rights.” The applicant has also told the court that the fourth respondent came to her office at 385 Ikorodu Road, Lagos, in the company of other police officers. They told her manager that while investigating a case of fraud and stealing against one Orisumbola Adekunle John, they traced the sum of N30 million, which was suspected to be part of the proceed of the stolen fund, to her UMZ Ventures Resources account number 5600748621 domiciled with Fidelity Bank, and therefore needed clarification on the issue.
