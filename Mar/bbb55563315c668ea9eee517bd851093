Ten Hag wants Manchester United to make at least two significant signings in the summer transfer window, and one of his top targets is Victor Osimhen. Manchester Evening News  suggests that Ajax’s Mohammed Kudus and Napoli’s Victor Osimhen are on Erik ten Hag’s list for the summer, and he is pushing Manchester United to strengthen the team for the next season. The 24-year-old Osimhen has scored 24 goals for Napoli this season. It is expected that Napoli will try to keep him and wants at least €100million for their talisman. Osimhen is under contract with Napoli until 2025. Manchester Evening News also claims that Tottenham’s Harry Kane is on United’s list, and Ten Hag is an admirer of Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos. Signing a striker and midfielder is United’s priority in the next transfer window. They also may sign a center-back if captain Harry Maguire leaves. Man United will also listen to offers for Alex Telles and Anthony Martial. The Red Devils ended their six-year trophy drought by beating Newcastle United 2-0 to win the Carabao Cup at Wembley on Sunday. They remain in contention for the Premier League, FA Cup, and UEFA Europa League this season. Ten Hag’s side will face West Ham in the FA Cup fifth round on Wednesday.
