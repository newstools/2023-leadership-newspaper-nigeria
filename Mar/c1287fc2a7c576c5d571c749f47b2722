 A Port Harcourt-based cleric, Pastor Akeem Idoniboye, has called on Nigerians to come out on March 11, 2023, to vote for their choice in the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections and not to be discouraged by the outcome of the just-concluded presidential and National Assembly elections. Idoniboye, who is the Lead Pastor of the Glorious Destiny Family Church (Destiny Chapel), made the call yesterday while preaching a sermon at the church auditorium in Borokiri, Port Harcourt. The cleric said, “I want to tell you something. Don’t be discouraged by what happened. Come out on Saturday and vote for candidates of your choice. “If the good is discouraged, then, the bad keeps trending. If the good keeps pushing, keeps pushing, keeps pushing, the bad will no longer trend. The good needs to keep showing up until the bad is tired.” In his sermon, Idoniboye, who quoted Genesis 22:1-4, described Christianity as sacrificial, saying that no one who is not submissive to Jehovah Jireh, can see him. He said, “Christianity is sacrificial. You will never really see Jehovah Jireh if you don’t submit to him. The presence of battles is not proof that God is not present. Submission is necessary for authority. “Many persons don’t like control; many persons don’t like submission. That you love God is not enough. You must be honest; you must be committed and you must be submissive. Delayed obedience is dishonour. Doing it when you like is dishonour, doing it when you like is dishonour. “You will never find fulfilment in life until you sense the will of God. It takes spiritual sensibility to get it right in life.”
