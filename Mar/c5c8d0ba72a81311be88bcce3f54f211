 Nigeria’s Flying Eagles are through to the semi-finals of the ongoing U20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and also book a ticket to the FIFA U20 World Cup in Indonesia after beating their Uganda’s counterparts 1-0 yesterday’s evening. A first half own goal by Uganda’s Ibrahim Juma, earned Ladan Bosso’s side the needed victory at the Suez Canal Authority Stadium in Ismailia in a close fought second quarterfinal match of the 17th Africa U20 Cup of Nations. Goalkeeper Chijioke Aniagboso, who has been huge for the Flying Eagles since taking over the sticks after the opening day defeat to Senegal in Cairo, captained in the absence of the suspended Daniel Bameyi, but was unfazed by the band and gave another assuring performance for the seven-time champions. As early as the 10th minute, he had to enact a reflex save to stop a bullet header from a corner kick. Both teams continued to frisk for opportunities with Nigeria’s Ibrahim Muhammad and Haliru Sarki probing deep but undone mostly by inaccurate passes and poor ball-holding in the final quarter. However, on the dot of half hour, Ibrahim Muhammad, who scored one of the goals that sank Mozambique on the final day of Group A attrition, latched onto a long ball from the defence, controlled well and fired. His effort saw the ball hit the upright, and in his confusion, defender Ibrahim Juma helped the ball into his own net for the only goal of the match. Muhammad should have made it two to purchase a cruise for Nigeria only four minutes after the restart, but he put too much power behind his turn and shot. On the hour mark and seven minutes after, Aniagboso saved point-blank efforts that sustained Nigeria’s lead, and in the 80th minute, Samson Lawal spun the ball away from goal from a 22 -yard free-kick. Victory earned Nigeria a slot in Monday’s semi-finals as well as a ticket to Indonesia. The Flying Eagles will take on the winner of the clash between Congo and Tunisia, happening at the Cairo International Stadium on Friday.
