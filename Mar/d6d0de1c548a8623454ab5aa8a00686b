Gombe State governor Inuwa Yahaya has congratulated the president- elect of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the vice president- elect, Kashim Shettima, on their victory at the just- concluded presidential election. In a congratulatory message he personally signed which was issued to journalists yesterday, the governor said, Tinubu’s victory at the polls is a manifestation of his years of personal commitment, sacrifice, tenacity, political experience and service to the nation. He said the president-elect is a well-groomed leader with vast wealth of experience and network as a former governor, senator and political leader who has the competence and character to hit the ground running and build on the successes of President Muhammadu Buhari in all facets of human endeavour. “Tinubu’s antecedents in governance and his huge political connections are a good asset for a renewed hope and expression of national unity of purpose. “Tinubu is an enigmatic leader and strong pillar with immense influence. I am confident in his acumen and sagacity to unite Nigeria having been building bridges across the length and breadth of the country which has resulted in the historic victory,” Inuwa said. He said Tinubu is able and capable to lead the nation, having governed Lagos State with a magic wand. The governor also commended president Muhammadu Buhari for providing leadership and support that led to the enthronement of a sustainable democracy and urged Nigerians to rally round the new president to move Nigeria forward.
