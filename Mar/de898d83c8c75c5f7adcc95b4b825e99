Governor of Imo State Hope Uzodimma has urged the people of the state not to be discouraged by the outcome of the recently held presidential and National Assembly elections, urging them to come out on Saturday, March 11, 2023 to vote in the state assembly elections. Uzodimma made the appeal at the Government House, Owerri while addressing the citizenry. The governor enjoined Imo people to be more realistic in their decisions, noting that “Nigeria is a national project and there is every need to be part of the federation.” He reminded Imo people once more that “government is about the people” hence they should not be discouraged because their preferred presidential candidate or any other candidate for that matter did not win the last election. “You should see reasons to come out and vote on Saturday,” he said. Turning to his party, Governor Uzodimma promised to do his best to ensure that the APC wins the election on Saturday, even as he advised party members to devote time to organise the LGAs for the task ahead. The governor used the opportunity to thank all those who participated in the February 25, 2023 election as well as those who did not participate, and congratulated all winners. On the inconclusive polls, he sought for God’s intervention. Uzodimma however bemoaned a situation where some party faithful who were given responsibilities sat on the fence and described the act as sabotage. “There is nothing to gain by sabotaging the system already put in place for the success of a programme,” he added. He said that those who withheld resources mapped out for elections or went to a corner to hide, showed the highest level of sabotage and appealed to all not to sabotage themselves, because “both God and government see such bad behaviour.” He thanked the clergy and the people for their fervent prayers that made it possible for people to come out and vote and urged them not to relent “because it is not over until it is over.”
