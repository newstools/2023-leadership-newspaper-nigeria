The Enugu State Labour Party (LP), governorship candidate for the 2023 polls, Barrister Chijioke Edeoga, has attributed the huge successes recorded by the party in the state and parts of Nigeria during last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly (NASS) election to the present monetary policy and signing of the new Electoral Act by president Muhammadu Buhari.
He said the decision addressed the usual cancer worm called vote buying during elections in the country.
Edeoga, who lauded President Buhari for the feat, equally applauded all key stakeholders in the electoral process in the state, including the media and security agencies for making sure that the electorate voted candidates of their choice.
He specifically thanked the Enugu electorate for coming out and voting massively for the Labour Party, urging them to kindly replicate the same gesture come March 11, 2023 for the governorship and state assembly elections.
Speaking with journalists Monday in Enugu, the former member of the Federal House of Representatives, who was declared the authentic governorship candidate of the LP in Enugu State by the Supreme Court, said he was highly impressed with the overwhelming turnout of voters in the state last Saturday elections.
He lauded the judgment which went In his favour and hailed the panel of judges of the nation’s apex court that gave the verdict, especially for upholding the truth on the case which was filed against him by Chief Everest Nnaji
“I want to use this opportunity of this press conference to thank the Enugu electorate for the massive support they gave to the labour party during last Saturday’s presidential and national assembly election. The result is beyond the imagination of everybody “I want to also thank all interest groups, the media, church, security INEC and others for the roles they all played. I want to thank president Buhari for signing the electoral act and new monetary policy which took care of vote buying” he stated
