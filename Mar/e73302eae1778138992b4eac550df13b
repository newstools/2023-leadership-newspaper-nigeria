 A Senior Magistrate Court presided by Ibrahim Mansur Yola, has remanded the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon. Alhassan Ado Doguwa, in Goron Dutse Correctional Centre over alleged offences bordering on criminal conspiracy, mischief, illegal possession of firearms, culpable homicide and disturbance of public peace. Others charged alongside Doguwa but at large were Nazifi Asnanic, Nafiu Musa, Hamisu Amadu and Abdulhadi Alaramma. Doguwa was accused of burning a building that resulted to the death of Alasan Mohammed and Aminu Malam Amadu while Bashir Yani, Labaran Sule and one Amadu were injured in the attack. The offences are contrary to Sections 97, 114, 247, 336 and 221 of Penal Code. The Prosecution Counsel, Barrister Aisha Salisu, prayed the Court to remand the two defendants and set another day for arraignment to enable the office of the State’s Attorney General review the case. Hon. Doguwa’s counsel, Abdul Adamu, prayed for bail for the accused and assured the Magistrate that his client would not jump bail if granted. He added that the accused would strictly abide by the bail conditions in view of the fact that he is a serving member of House of Representatives and member-elect for Doguwa/Tudun Wada Federal Constituency of Kano State. The prosecution counsel, however, argued that any person charged with culpable homicide shall not be granted bail unless at the High Court. Citing Section 127 of Criminal Justice Law 2019, the prosecution counsel argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to try the offence and as such, it can not grant bail to the accused. In his ruling, Senior Magistrate Ibrahim Mansur Yola ordered that the accused be ramanded in Goron Dutse Prison and adjourned the case until March 7, 2023.
