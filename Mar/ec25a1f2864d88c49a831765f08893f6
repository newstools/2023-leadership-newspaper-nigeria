Governor of Abia State Okezie Ikpeazu has said he is not losing sleep over his defeat at the senatorial election by Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe in last Saturday’s National Assembly election. Ikpeazu, who said he was thankful to God for the opportunity of serving Abia State as governor for eight years, told journalists that he was grateful to God that no life was lost in the election as he was not ready to engage in violence or spill blood to win an election. Ikpeazu, rather said that in any democratic setting, it was expected that one wins some battles and loses some others. Asked about his loss of the election for the Abia State South senatorial seat, Ikpeazu said, “Yes in elections, you win some and you lose some. It is service and if somehow the opportunity fails to come to you, you thank God for the ones you won.  I cannot spill blood for politics. I am a happy man and now focused on the 11th March governorship election.” The governor acknowledged that the effect of the Peter Obi candidacy affected most of the results from the South East and said it was important to focus on the governorship election coming up in about 10 days’ time. He said the Igbo would “take stock of the Obi wave and it’s socio-political impact.” He said, “Tell our detractors that Dr ikpeazu has won two gubernatorial elections in Abia and by God’s grace defeated COVID-19. He can count his blessings.  In eight years as a governor, he restored peace and security, built four bridges and 200 roads; built a paediatric hospital, 700 classroom blocks, four model schools, gave overseas scholarship to 51 Abians among other things, all in eight years. That is to show that he came to serve without bitterness and attention to naysayers. Ikpeazu has promised to finish the new Government House, Umuahia, finish the new modern diagnostic lab in Isuikwuato and a mega hospital in Aba. I can count my blessings. Let all men count theirs.  It’s not how long but how well.”
