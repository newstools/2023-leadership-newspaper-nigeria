 A Northern elder statesman, Alhaji Musan Musawa, is dead. Born on April 1, 1937, the deceased was a broadcaster, diplomat and astute politician. He died on Tuesday following a protracted illness. Alhaji Musan Musawa is survived by a number of children and other family members, including the deputy spokesperson of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Barrister Hannatu Musawa, who is also a weekly columnist with the LEADERSHIP Newspapers Group. Meanwhile, the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has expressed sorrow over the loss of the elder statesman. In a statement Tuesday evening by his media office, Tinubu described the late statesman from Katsina State as one of the last bastions of freedom fighters who fought for Nigeria’s independence. “He was a truly progressive and broadminded statesman. As a young man, he joined forces with like-minded comrades in the defunct Northern Elements Progressive Union (NEPU) to fight for Independence and total liberation of our people. “In the years since independence Alhaji Musa Musawa continued to ally with progressive movements in and outside the realm of politics to advance the cause of the poor and oppressed in the society. “He was a progressive politician who paid his dues as a dedicated patriot. Nigeria has lost an illustrious son and we would miss his fatherly counsel at a time we need it the most,” Tinubu said. The president-elect prayed Almighty Allah to forgive the shortcomings of the departed elder and offer his family the needed consolation at their moment of grief.
