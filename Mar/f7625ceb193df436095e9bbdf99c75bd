The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Airtel Africa, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), United Capital, Lafarge Africa and UAC of Nigeria (UACN). Analysts noted that the market has rallied significantly in consecutive months, raising fears of an over-extended market, saying, “we expect sustained bullish sentiments as we anticipate downbeat money market yields till Q2, 2023. Technical indicators point to a more significant downside potential for equities. “We consider buying equities a ‘riskier’ rather than a ‘wrong’ strategy while favouring reducing portfolio exposures as the ideal approach. Equity stakeholders can look to book profits off stocks that have crossed the overbought region, as the RSI indicates.” However, market breadth closed positive  as 30 stocks gained relative to 12 decliners.
