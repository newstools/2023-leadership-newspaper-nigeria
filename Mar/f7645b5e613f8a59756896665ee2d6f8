The Confederation of African Football has assigned Egyptian referee Ahmed Nagy Mosa as referee for today’s Africa U20 Cup of Nations between Nigeria’s Flying Eagles and Ugandan counterparts at the Suez Canal Authority Stadium in Ismailia, Egypt. Mosa will be supported by compatriots Mohamed Abouzid Halhal (assistant referee 1) and Yara Atef (assistant referee 2), as well as Libyan official Abdulrazg Ahmed (fourth official). Justin Mumba from Zambia will be the match commissioner while Rosalie N’dah from Benin Republic will serve as referee assessor and Namibian Titus Kunamuene will be in the role of general coordinator. Meanwhile, the Flying Eagles on Wednesday intensified their training ahead of the clash, which will be on the same turf on which they defeated Mozambique 2-0 on Saturday, with goals from Samson Lawal and Ibrahim Muhammad. A win against the Hippos will qualify the Flying Eagles for their 13th appearance at the FIFA U20 World Cup finals, with this year’s tournament billed for Indonesia 20th May – 11th June. Speaking ahead of the match, Flying Eagles coach, Isah Ladan Bosso, said he has the men to push Uganda’s Hippos off the way in their Africa U20 Cup of Nations quarter-final duel and reach the FIFA U20 World Cup finals. “Before we left our training camp in Morocco, the NFF President, Alhaji Ibrahim Musa Gusau told us clearly that the first objective should be getting a ticket to the FIFA World Cup. We are at that most important stage now and we cannot afford to falter. “We are aware that Nigerians are looking up to us to deliver. While our mission remains bagging the World Cup ticket, we are also eyeing the trophy, which is still a number of matches away. For the moment, we have Uganda in our view and we are working hard to see that we control proceedings on Thursday.”
